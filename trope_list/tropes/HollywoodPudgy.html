</p><p>Like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely">Hollywood Homely</a> characters, if you took the Hollywood Pudgy character out of her movie and plunked her down among a representative sample of real women, she'd fit in because she looks normal, even good in comparison. As an average-sized person, the Hollywood Pudgy character is or appears to be overweight by medical standards but not nearly obese. She'd have no trouble fitting through bus turnstiles or into a cute bathing suit, and wouldn't have her doctor telling her she must lose twenty pounds for the sake of her heart and pancreas.
</p><p>This does <em>not</em> apply to stories in which a skinny woman thinks of herself as fat, but is shown to have an eating disorder or body image problem. That would probably fall under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotPretty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotPretty">I Am Not Pretty</a> instead. Satirical examples hang a lantern on the absurdity of calling thin women fat.

For example, any time a male celeb known for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice">Mr. Fanservice</a> goes from a sculpted physique to a more average body type, the media will rant about his "dadbod" and how he "let himself go," and may speculate on his mental health, even if he's nowhere near overweight and might even be <em>happier</em> not having to maintain an impossible image. However, you're less likely to see this trope applied to men onscreen, since Hollywood is far more likely to cast an appropriate actor to play an overweight male character thanks to age-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standards</a>.
</p><p>Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely">Hollywood Homely</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnkemptBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnkemptBeauty">Unkempt Beauty</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuscleAngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuscleAngst">Muscle Angst</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulWoman">Big Beautiful Woman</a>.

This is NOT the page for actors of normal body type playing characters of normal body type, nor for genuinely fat actors playing genuinely fat characters. Anything that is drawn or animated is also extremely unlikely to qualify (Garfield, for example, doesn't even look <em>like a cat</em>), unless the depiction is intended to be realistic or the trope itself is being parodied. If the only time the character's said or implied to be fat is when another character is tossing out insults, it probably belongs under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreFat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreFat">You Are Fat</a> instead of this trope.
</p><p>Also in real life when singers and band members prepare to go on tour, it is very common for them to overindulge and voluntarily take on weight. If the show is of any quality (especially for pop, rock and metal type bands and singers), they will likely lose it right back before they get back home. Of course this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Paparazzi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Paparazzi">paparazzi</a> fuel.

<ul><li> Many ads for Kellogg's products, such as Special K cereal, will encourage the viewer to replace two of their meals a day with the cereal in order to lose weight. The majority of these ads will feature a woman being portrayed as overweight or too chubby to wear a particular piece of clothing they have their eye on. They successfully complete the diet plan and show off their newly-slim bodies... except just about every woman in these ads is <em>already thin to begin with</em>, thus making the shown weight-loss unnoticeable and also completely ignoring the "for ages 18 and over with BMI 25+ " disclaimers at the bottom of the screen. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDijSmJYOS0">This<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is just one of the advertisements.
<ul><li> Especially annoying are the Special K ads which are run after Christmas, in which women who are on the low side of average size are mistaken for Santa Claus by <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHkPUvuDNMQ&amp;feature=related">children<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ebb54ElG-A">Santa's sleigh team<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. In the former, the "overweight" woman is portrayed by the gorgeous actress <a class="urllink" href="https://www.listal.com/viewimage/836881">Stacy Edwards<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. In the latter, the woman is dressed in a bulky coat, a heavy scarf, and an unflattering hat, which would make <em>anybody</em> look 20 lbs. heavier.
</li><li> The ad campaign for Special K in the 1970s was just about as bad. They encouraged viewers to "do the Special K pinch", which meant to pinch some part of their midsection. The message was, "If you can pinch more than an inch, you should probably be watching your weight." The problem here is that skin, subcutaneous muscle tissue, etc. can all be pinched around the abdomen, so it's very easy even for someone who's <em>underweight</em> to pinch more than an inch. Even chronic anorexics can pinch more than an inch, if they're hunched over. Also, since it takes a little time for skin to snap back after weight loss, it's possible to still pinch more than an inch even just after you've lost weight.
</li></ul></li><li> An ad for the zero calorie sweetener Truvia features an extremely thin woman scarfing down cheesecake, while a cutesy jingle that's supposed to be her inner monologue laments that real sugar made her "butt fat."
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YarpWrLn9Zo">This ad<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for Safe Food, where nobody appears to be unhealthily overweight, bar a small bulge in the belly. Make even funnier by Safe Food's slogan, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Be Safe, Be Healthy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DemolitionMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DemolitionMan">Be Well</a>."
</li><li> There are those series of Subway commercials showing a montage of various people eating fast food, only to have a button pop off of their shirt or fall through whatever they were sitting on. These commercials tend to be slightly aggravating given that out of all of the people in those commercials, one or two may be a little overweight.
</li><li> Just about any commercial for a weight loss program like Weight Watchers. Such commercials will show "before and after" photos of men and women who have successfully completed the program. The problem is that, in some instances, they actually look better in the "before" photos than in the "after" photos.
<ul><li> In cases of weight loss pills like Hydroxicut, several of the men depicted are already quite fit in their "before" picture, clearly defined abs and all. Apparently that guy's sculpted physique was disgusting until he dropped a little excess weight and got only slightly more defined.
</li></ul></li><li> Australain plus-size model Robyn Lawley is noticeably more curvaceous than other supermodels, but still a long way from being genuinely fat. If she's ever modelling a swimsuit, odds are it's marketed towards women much larger than herself.
</li><li> Calvin Klein got a lot of criticism in 2014 for promoting <a class="urllink" href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/nov/11/-sp-myla-dalbesio-calvin-kleins-new-model-size-10-plus-size">Myla Dalbesio<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, whose ribcage was visible in one pose, as their first "plus size" model.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Anime &amp; Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> It should be noted that by some accounts, Japanese culture is extremely lipophobic. In a country where people eat mostly fish and rice and typically do 2 hours of aerobics every day, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">body image standards can get pretty warped</a>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88">Area 88</a></em> manga, Greg is referred to as fat. He's stout (but nowhere near obese) compared to the rest of the rail-thin cast.
</li><li> Sumira Hara from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom">Assassination Classroom</a></em> is occasionally labeled as fat despite only really being slightly wider than the rest of the girls.
</li><li> Semimaru from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds">7 Seeds</a></em> referred to himself as slightly overweight, saying that his old ways of drinking alcohol, smoking and generally being a lazy bum left him with 'a slight belly'. At no point is he ever drawn differently from the other characters, nor is his supposedly overweight stomach ever seen, until he mentions that the toll of surviving in the post-apocalyptic world has gotten rid of it.
</li><li> Stocking from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantyAndStockingWithGarterbelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantyAndStockingWithGarterbelt">Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt</a></em> has quite a sweet-tooth, and one episode shows her wearing a monitor and going on a diet, much to Panty's taunting delight. She in enraged over Chuck's hogging her beloved sweets, eats them herself, then later laments over how she'll likely be "back" to her normal proportions by the next day. Yet her physical appearance never changes, and she's still hot enough to pull off that explicit henshin...
</li><li> Choji Akimichi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> is a bit of a subversion, however he supposedly weighs less than 200 lbs (192 to be exact, or 87.5 kg), which in most men isn't really that fat. He was also quite rotund as a child, however, when he would definitely have been considered overweight. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromCalories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromCalories">combat style</a> also requires him to have plenty of body fat, since his ultimate attack burns off that fat to give him temporary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> (even by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBadass">World of Badass</a> standards of <em>Naruto</em>).
</li><li> In the fourth episode of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> anime Serena/Usagi is worried that she has gained a little weight. Visually, she hasn't changed at all. Fortunately, in the <em>show</em>, nobody except Usagi notices. The dub even exaggerated this a step further by having "Serena" freak out about gaining a grand total of...half a pound. The rest of the episode shows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain">Jadeite</a> preying on women with body issues by using machines that make them skinny while sucking out their life energy until they become emaciated (and it is implied that they will die after enough sessions). Strangely, the dub attempts to pretend the machines don't work despite the fact that all the victims are visibly skinnier and skeletal. Either way, it's still not <em>enforcing</em> a certain body type, but mocking the obsession with being skinny that leads perfectly attractive women to starve themselves.
<ul><li> It's still worth noting that while Usagi/Serena's family doesn't give it much importance, their comments imply that she is indeed "a bit chubby" in their eyes and that she should probably eat less and exercise more (Luna also thinks this way). While they <em>may</em> just mean to encourage her into a more healthy lifestyle (or playfully mock her worries) rather than to have her get thinner, they never clarify this (cue Usagi/Serena crying at hearing them).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/SailorMoonAbridged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/SailorMoonAbridged">Sailor Moon Abridged</a> takes this and runs with it, having every character point out how overweight she allegedly is. Naturally, the art hasn't changed a bit; she's every bit as skinny as she is in the actual show.
</li><li> Also happens in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV">Codename: Sailor V</a></em>, where Minako in fact gained some weight but was almost unnoticeable. Minako freaked out so much she started doing exercise like mad under Artemis' direction, losing the excess fat... And still weighing a little too much, this time <em>in muscles</em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterMentor">Artemis had been trying to train Minako's strength for months, you see</a>). The same couldn't be said for the people of Tokyo, since this was the latest scheme of the Dark Agency. Basically everyone else besides Minako, her friend Hikaru (who has a very healthy diet) and the police officer Wakagi (who hates sweets) had noticeably gotten fatter because of some special chocolates being distributed around Valentine's Day. It reached a point that "fat" was the new in-look even though everyone was going like crazy trying to lose the weight.
</li></ul></li><li> Yomi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh">Azumanga Daioh</a></em> has weight issues, even though she's no less thin than the other girls on the show. The liner notes in one of the DVDs notes that her obsession with her weight was given to her to give her a slightly more "normal" quirk than the other girls, so its clear that this was more in Yomi's head than an actual problem. Tomo also teases her for being fat, but Tomo is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> that spends her life tormenting Yomi in any way she can think of.
</li><li> Fuuka from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Yotsuba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Yotsuba">Yotsuba&amp;!</a></em> (done by the same mangaka who created <em>Azumanga Daioh</em>) often angsts over supposedly being too chubby, even though her body type isn't much different from the other teenage girls seen in the series. It's apparently noticeable enough in-story that her <em>own mother and sisters</em> frequently comment on her fat legs.
</li><li> Likewise, Kagami from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar">Lucky Star</a></em> often complains about her weight despite not being fat, especially after indulging her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetTooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetTooth">Sweet Tooth</a>. But as Konata pointed out, "You don't look any different if you gain a kilo or two."
</li><li> In the rather obscure anime series <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1427">Onegai! Samia Don<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> (aka <em>Psammead the Magic Genie</em>, based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiveChildrenAndIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiveChildrenAndIt">Five Children and It</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ENesbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ENesbit">E. Nesbit</a>); Anne Hopkins, the eldest girl, is working out to be thin, and despite not being overweight at all, ponders asking Psammead help (but knowing that her wish might backfire, she doesn't).
</li><li> Male example: America in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em> doesn't look fat, but when he steps onto the weight scale, it actually sweats carrying his weight and he looks completely mortified seeing the numbers. Though it could also be joking about this trope as well.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> suggests that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.hetarchive.net/scanlations/extra.php?matome_heta">the weight is muscle<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and that America simply doesn't know any better.
</li><li> Finland is another male example: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has stated that he is a little chubby, but he looks like <a class="urllink" href="http://www.hetarchive.net/scanlations/event.php?chrismas_bonsai3">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

However, she seems to weigh the same as her sister. Granted, Jeanne <em>does</em> frequently demand that Cinderella make her food.
</li><li> Hiro of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HidamariSketch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HidamariSketch">Hidamari Sketch</a></em> is also very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">sensitive</a> to her weight; different signs may imply she is kind of on the fat side (like Miyako's teasing or her open preference in Renoir because he drew Rubenesque women), but it's not something we can see in the manga or anime, particularly because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuniPlush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuniPlush">art-style</a>...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi">Rumiko Takahashi</a> actually did a one-shot manga about such a girl going to a weight-loss camp because of a new dress that was only slightly too tight on her. She ends up getting a better body image by the end, however.
</li><li> Hige from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain">Wolf's Rain</a></em> is an interesting case, as he has two forms, human and wolf. He earns the nickname "Porky" from Tsume, and his canine form is indeed noticeably overweight. On the other hand, most of the time in the series the viewer only sees his human projection, and the only indication that the image he projects <em>might</em> be heavier than the others is that he doesn't wear skinny-jeans or tight leather pants like the others do, leaving a Hollywood Pudgy impression.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> there was a story later in the manga about a magical gi. When female Ranma tries to wear it she learns it only fits someone with Akane's supposedly dumpier physique.

</li><li> Tsukimi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrincessJellyfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrincessJellyfish">Princess Jellyfish</a></em> is sometimes called chubby by people in the fashion industry, but she's really just short and has a somewhat round Japanese face.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi">Fushigi Yuugi</a></em> subverts this trope with Miaka, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YuuWatase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YuuWatase">Yuu Watase</a> has pointed out and shown in the manga that she really is supposed to be pudgy (though after distress galore in the book, she loses weight). In the anime, however, she's a bodaciously brawny babe who at one point fantasizes about having the body of a supermodel. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Well, she got her wish</a>... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearRapeExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearRapeExperience">or</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape">not</a>.

The first person is a high school girl who genuinely is overweight because of low self-esteem issues (she overeats when she's upset). The second person is a boxer who needs to keep his weight down so that he can stay in the proper weight class. The third person is a model who is rail skinny as she is but asks the Count to give her a mysterious pill that her fellow model told her about. The model explains that her body is her "calling card" and gaining even a pound could mean losing a lot of expensive clients. Throughout the chapter, the animals are all very distressed and confused at the thought of someone willingly starving themselves as they know what it is like to really be without food. While the first two people get happy endings (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the girl loses the weight thanks to self-esteem boosts from a training partner the Count loans her and the boxer makes his weight class</span>), the model <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">becomes violently sick after taking the pill for some time, until her body becomes dried up and breaks open to let an alien version of the model out. It is also revealed that the other model - who told her about the pill to begin with - had the same thing happen to her</span>. The message of the chapter seemed to be that there was more to life than shedding a few pounds, especially since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the characters that were dieting for non-selfish reasons actually had happy endings and got more out of it</span>.

</li><li> Sakurai Rihoko from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Amagami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Amagami">Amagami</a></em> is a textbook example. Based on her character design, she'd just be around the upper-bound of average sized waistline and chubbiness.
</li><li> Mio and Mugi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a></em> tend to get worried about their weight gain at the end of the year, and are envious of Yui's high metabolism. Even Ritsu can be manipulated into drum practice with this fear, though. However according to Ritsu, Mio's weight goes to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter">breasts</a>.

Chapter 39 shows on more than one occasion that she really is physically heavy, at least compared to Merry, just not to the point of being unhealthy.
</li><li> Ayako of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SlamDunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SlamDunk">Slam Dunk</a></em> goes on a diet at the end of the series. Admittedly, she is drawn as curvier then Haruko and with a rounder face, but considering how many characters refer to her as attractive it's pretty obvious she's just being paranoid.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HighschoolOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HighschoolOfTheDead">Highschool of the Dead</a></em>: Though Saya often refers to Hirano as "fatty"/"fatass", he's hardly what one would consider overweight.

But as the series underwent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a>, he changed from portly, to stocky.

Long before she'd actually appeared on-panel, all the audience is told about her is that she's lazy and has gained considerable weight due to being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eater</a>. She's actually referred to as being "fat", but when she actually appears on panel she's a pretty young woman with a rounded face and generous bust.

In one episode of the anime where Misae took up ballet, the male instructor broke his spine trying to pick her up. The same episode has Misae freaking out over weighing 55kg (121lb) even though she's 159 cm (5'2.5) tall.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePoundGospel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePoundGospel">One Pound Gospel</a></em> has Kosaku Hatanaka, who is often referred as a fat pig in spite of a very fit body, and Taro Matsuzaka, who was called a whale to his face in spite of being just slightly pudgy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">There's a very good reason</a>: they're boxers below the heavyweight category, thus with very strict limits on what they can weigh in order to compete, and seeing any visible fat on these guys would be taken as a sign of being in sub-optimal shape for the bout-hence Kosaku, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">who just can't help but eating a lot</a> and tends to have trouble passing the weigh-in, being called a pig, while Matsuzaka, a natural flyweight (between 108 and 114 pounds), was fixated on fighting him and purposefully fattened himself up to reach featherweight category (between 123 and 126 pounds).
</li><li> Tsumugi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Pochamani" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Pochamani">Pochamani</a></em> is kinda chubby for a girl of her short stature but the story and characters treat her like she's the tubbiest girl they've ever seen. As the series goes on, the art does a slightly better job at depicting Tsumugi and other chubby girls as being more plus sized, but never as heavy as the story claims they are.
</li><li> The monster girls from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PlusSizedElf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PlusSizedElf">Plus-Sized Elf</a></em> all have troubles maintaining their weight, but most of their weight gain is either in the most attractive parts of their body or so minor that it's barely noticeable. If Elfuda simply went up a single dress size then her trademark muffin top would be completely hidden.
<ul><li> Averted with Oku, who is legitimately stout, as well as the few times Elfuda overeats and temporarily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryBulkChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryBulkChange">gains a lot of weight</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The titular character of <em>Alicia's Diet Quest</em> is obsessed losing weight even though she's as thin as a rail. The only issue is that she basically went up one dress size after attending one too many feasts, yet everyone acts as if she has a thick layer of blubber. So much so that at one point a group of obese orcs somehow accidentally mistake her for one of them.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The eponymous lead of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Empowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Empowered">Empowered</a></em> seems to suffer from this big time, as she constantly refers to herself as chubby and pudgy (as do some of her teammates, supervillains, the media, random loudmouths on the internet, etc.), though technically she should be on par with a 20-something white chick with some decent curvature. It is telling that the only female character who is significantly skinnier than Emp publicly dismisses her complaints as "grenade-fishing for compliments" and privately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">considers her extremely sexy</a>.
<ul><li> This is likely done to highlight the main character's MASSIVE self-esteem issues, aggravated by being around superheroes with perfect comic book figures. It really doesn't help that she has to seriously diet and exercise to keep in shape, while pretty much all of the other female supers are implied to have gotten their figures along with her powers. Especially Sistah Spooky, who's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eater</a> and has an ongoing spell that displaces excess mass to her nearby enemies, and poor Emp is almost certainly at the top of that list.
</li><li> Furthermore, her soap-bubble thin costume is really skintight, and stops working, cutting her off from her superpowers, whenever she hides it, even with a small mantle. As a result, she's basically naked all times, while other heroines are allowed to accessorize and highlight their best assets.
</li></ul></li><li> A throw-away gag during the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewAvengers">New Avengers</a></em> tenure has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderWoman">Jessica Drew</a> entering <em>The Raft</em>, a high security prison, with a bag of donuts in her hands loudly complaining about how fat she got in the previous months of inactivity, and offering to share her breakfast with whoever is able to provide her with suitable information about an impending breakout. While the villains fall for the trick (loudly asking for Jessica to surrender the donuts in exchange for their full, unbridled cooperation, implying that the usual gruel they're usually served is really foul), Jessica's implied image issues are somewhat lessened by her skintight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotLibrarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotLibrarian">Hot Librarian</a> tailleur, showing off her usual voluptuous physique, busty but nowhere as fat to need dieting.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CarolDanvers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CarolDanvers">Carol Danvers</a>, is the subject of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> where people (usually villains) insult her by saying she's fat. Like Jessica, her build is usually indistinguishable from 99 percent of the other superheroines published by Marvel and DC. The source of the joke may be Carol's bottom, which is canonically large.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateXMen">Ultimate X-Men</a></em> makes constant jibes about Beast/Henry McCoy's weight, but, like the rest of his comic-book brethren, he is drawn as being quite fit and muscular, albeit perhaps larger and more muscular than the others.
</li><li> Tarot's mom, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TarotWitchOfTheBlackRose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TarotWitchOfTheBlackRose">Tarot: Witch of the Black Rose</a></em>. As expected from a mother of two, now in her late forties-early fifties, she's grown noticeably fatter than her smoking hot daughters. However, instead of looking pudgy and fat, she looks exactly like a wider version of Rowena, her youngest daughter and the titular <em>Witch of the Black Rose</em>.
</li><li> Can apply somewhat to Gert in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em>, as it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist">depends on the artist</a>. Under main artist Adrian Alphona's pen, Gert actually is fairly chubby, but other artists tend to draw her as just having slightly more hips and waist than Nico or Karolina, and even Alphona drew her that way to start with. Here, it may not be so much a case of warped values as it is comic artists just not being used to drawing women with that sort of body. Also, Marvel's official stats list her at 5'1'' and 125 pounds. The Alphona version, if she was 5'1", would probably be at least 140. Likewise, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hulu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hulu">Hulu</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Runaways2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Runaways2017">adaptation</a>, while the actress playing Gert is certainly curvier than the other actresses, she's not actually all that big.

She started out as a back-up to an anorexic blond who insults her for her incredibly voluptuous figure. The blond ends up getting edged out of the show and Doralis gains millions of male and female admirers.
</li><li> The First American in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TomorrowStories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TomorrowStories">Tomorrow Stories</a></em> has a classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBuild">Heroic Build</a>, but is referred to frequently by other characters as though he were fat. He <em>does</em> have rather slovenly eating habits, but he's sculpted like Michelangelo's David for crying out loud! Subverted, in that a couple of panels strongly imply that his "sculpting" is due to support underwear and that he actually is fat.
</li><li> From the Threeboot continuity of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em>, Saturn Girl and Invisible Kid after Francis Manapul did redesigns of the characters. He made Imra more hippy and Lyle a bit rounder than a typical skinny kid, but neither could be called fat. Although Imra complains that people consider her "dumpy".
</li><li> Cornfed from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Livewires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Livewires">Livewires</a></em>, who was designed to look like a big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FarmBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FarmBoy">Farm Boy</a> because his frame is meant to store extra amounts of smartware in his body, primarily in his beer belly. But beyond that he's as muscular as Hollowpoint Ninja, and taller.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllFallDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllFallDown">All Fall Down</a></em>, Portia laments having gained nine pounds since she lost her powers (and her superhero metabolism).
</li><li> Renee Tempete in <em>I Hate Gallant Girl</em> is subjected to constant disparaging remarks about her weight and figure because she has, like, 3-5 pounds on GG. Part of the point here is that whatever physical flaws Renee has, they're blown ridiculously out of proportion by the superhero old guard; like Gallant Girl, she was a <em>beauty queen</em> before becoming a superheroine.
</li><li> Cloud 9 from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersTheInitiative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersTheInitiative">Avengers: The Initiative</a></em>. She thinks of herself as being overweight, but really isn't; she's just the only girl in the cast with a halfway realistic body shape.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a></em>: Although Etta Candy started as a rambunctious and sweets-addicted fat girl in the Golden Age <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1942" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1942">Wonder Woman</a></em> comics, her more modern depictions can be this trope, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist">Depending on the Artist</a> of course. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgePerez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgePerez">George Pérez</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987">reboot</a>, she started overweight, but then worked out and had a military muscular frame. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GailSimone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GailSimone">Gail Simone</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman2006">run</a>, the artists usually just had her looking slightly thicker than Diana, but otherwise being an average, curvy blonde woman (the change from her old self was eventually explained as being from her government training). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman2011">reboot</a> bypassed this, as that Etta was more conventionally slender and nobody ever commented about her weight. That got some criticism from some fans (similar to the protests about the New 52 Amanda Waller being slimmed down and youthened to become a generic sexpot) and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWomanRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWomanRebirth">Rebirth</a></em> Etta went back to being moderately heavy.
</li><li> Volcana, a minor super villain introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars1984">Secret Wars</a></em> is constantly referred to as fat despite being drawn with a curvy hourglass figure undistinguishable from any other super female. This continued through Secret Wars and into its sequel, which continually mentioned her love of doughnuts and other food. Eventually she began being drawn as somewhat overweight. Although her boyfriend, the omnipotent Molecule Man <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/HeartwarmingMoments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/HeartwarmingMoments">likes her just the way she is.</a>

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield">Garfield</a></em>, Jon occasionally complains about his body, saying he's chubby or even fat. It was a little more understandable in the earlier comics, when the strip was drawn more "realistically" (i.e., Garfield walked on four legs, everyone's proportions were generally more accurate, etc.); in those cases, Jim Davis would give Jon a slightly pudgier belly to justify his complaints (although he never reached fat, or even overweight, by any stretch of the imagination). But as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">time went on</a>, Jon looked more and more like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodlePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodlePeople">noodle person</a>, so the self-criticism makes no sense. Davis apparently agreed, as he gradually phased out the "Jon goes on a diet with Garfield" strips and had the fat cat taking them on alone.

<ul><li> In one scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles">The Incredibles</a></em>, Helen sees herself in the mirror when she's wearing her new superhero outfit, and lets out a sigh, clearly not pleased with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HartmanHips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HartmanHips">Hartman Hips</a> she's developed over the past 15 years. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> confirms this trope was deliberately invoked as she is being overly critical of her own physique: for a mother of three she's in great shape, especially compared to how out of shape her husband got, but at this point she's also afraid her husband is cheating on her and likely believes it might be because of her physique.
</li><li> Not an in-universe example, but some people consider <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Moana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Moana">Moana</a></em> chubby, especially compared to other cartoonishly thin Disney females, although Moana is more sturdy built realistically.

He's actually in pretty good shape, just sporting a very minor pizza gut which only seems to become noticeable when someone points it out.

The weight gain isn't that noticeable, but it gets her kicked out of the Plastics. Presumably it's a mockery of this trope, as Regina is considered fat because she can't fit into a size 5 dress.
</li><li> Jan, one of the Pink Ladies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Grease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Grease">Grease</a></em>, is constantly talking about how she should be dieting, but she's hungry. This could be put down to adolescent body image, except other characters ask her if she <em>really</em> wants to eat that, and Putzie asks her out, "romantically" saying that there's more to her "than just fat." The actress is not even slightly pudgy. No double chin, nothing but looser clothes than the other Pink Ladies and continuous mentions of her fat in the script. The original script actually <em>calls</em> for a chubby actress.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BridgetJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BridgetJones">Bridget Jones</a>: She weighed nine and a half stone (133 pounds). Yup, real whale there. Although the point might be that she <em>obsesses</em> about her weight so much, not that she's actually fat. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ReneeZellweger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ReneeZellweger">Renée Zellweger</a> at her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BridgetJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BridgetJones">Bridget Jones</a></em> weight was considered too fat for the cover of Harper's Bazaar. Zellweger as Bridget Jones was supposed to be a UK size 14 (which is a US size 10). She gained only enough weight to reach a size 6, but even this spawned dozens of newspaper and magazine articles on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyeingForYourArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyeingForYourArt">her weight gain</a>. Though during interviews at the time, she claimed to enjoy being heavier, she lost the weight as soon as filming was done and when it came time to film a sequel, she refused to gain weight until the studio literally paid her for every extra pound she put on.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToniCollette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToniCollette">Toni Collette</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MurielsWedding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MurielsWedding">Muriel's Wedding</a></em> put on 40 lbs. to play Muriel and ended up with a voluptuous pear shape that is obvious in this <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA-U_Kc-rd4">scene<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where she's wearing black leather.
</li><li> An hour into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RomyAndMichelesHighSchoolReunion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RomyAndMichelesHighSchoolReunion">Romy and Michele's High School Reunion</a></em>, Romy is referred to as "the chubby girl", even though (a) she is nowhere remotely close to chubby in either flashbacks or the present day, and (b) another character is far more deserving of the "chubby girl" distinction, in both flashbacks and the present day.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SexAndTheCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SexAndTheCity">Sex and the City</a></em> movie, Samantha eats to distract herself from thoughts of cheating, and when she flies out to New York it's considered a big deal when she sports a wee bit of a gut. It's said later that it's not so much that she's gotten 'fat', as according to Charlotte she would look great at any size, but that such weight gain is extremely out of character and indicative of some underlying problem. Granted, this felt a little shoehorned to try to avoid being accused of an 'if you aren't thin there's something wrong with you' implication, but at least they tried, if however half-halfheartedly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>: Dudley looks to be somewhere between normal and slightly pudgy, but he's supposed to be a fat slob (specifically, he's supposed to be <em>wider than his height</em>). This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness">Adaptational Attractiveness</a>, since he is genuinely fat in the books. Actor Harry Melling began studying ballet, and had to wear a fat suit for his brief appearance in <em>Deathly Hallows Part 1</em>. Ultimately the films make less a point about his weight than the books to sidestep this issue, and the books lay off mentioning his weight in the later books, saying his love for bully- ahem, boxing made him fit.
</li><li> Minnie Driver's character in <em>Circle of Friends</em> actually refers to herself as a "heifer" at one point. This mirrors reality somewhat; around the time of the film, talk shows were abuzz with excitement that an actress as plain and chubby as Minnie Driver could land a role as Chris O'Donnell's love interest.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SimonVsTheHomoSapiensAgenda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SimonVsTheHomoSapiensAgenda">Simon vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda</a></em>, Simon's friend Leah is overweight, stating flat out that she prefers people to call her fat than dance around it, and it's hinted that it contributes heavily to her insecurities when comparing herself to Abby. Meanwhile, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook">Love, Simon</a>, Katherine Langford might be curvy, but she's hardly plus sized. May be considered a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness">Adaptational Attractiveness</a>, though in the book Leah's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulWoman">not unattractive, she's just not skinny.</a> For comparison: Leah on <a class="urllink" href="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1510886704l/31180248.jpg">the cover of ''Leah on the Off Beat''<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> vs <a class="urllink" href="http://katherinelangford.org/photos/albums/Television/2010s/2017%2013%20Reasons%20Why/Season%201/BTS/107/002.jpg">the actress playing Leah.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>

This appears to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatCritics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatCritics">Take That, Critics!</a> to the British tabloids, who were obsessed with Martine McCutcheon (who plays Natalie) and her weight. For reference, <a class="urllink" href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/04/13/article-0-02B6E2EF000004B0-825_634x1056.jpg">this is what Martine McCuthcheon looks like in a bikini<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.

</li><li> This is one of the problems with the film <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avanti" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avanti">Avanti</a>!</em> where Juliet Mills was asked to gain about 25 lbs. for the part and even then she was hardly big enough to warrant any cracks about her weight.
</li><li> One of the cheerleaders in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BringItOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BringItOn">Bring It On</a></em> is told that her ass is enormous by a cheertator and is told to skip meals. Of course, she's thin and gorgeous. One of the cheerleaders in the sequel <em>Bring It On: All or Nothing</em> is supposedly fat, and is pressured to lose weight and is made fun of. By any normal standards she looks just as thin and sexy as the other cheerleaders. This is a deliberate criticism of the phenomenon, as the character who makes these comments is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> and it's played for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> moment.
</li><li> Perhaps played intentionally in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hook">Hook</a></em>, where Peter Banning (the former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a>) is mocked by the Lost Boys for being "old and <em>fat</em>", and Captain Hook himself calls him a "pitiful, spineless, pasty, <em>bloated</em> codfish." <a class="urllink" href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v482/80sFreakLurker/Others/Pervy23.jpg">Robin Williams wasn't out of shape<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, but he certainly wasn't as lean and fit as his former, adolescent, action-hero self.
</li><li> The brunette "ugly stepsister" Jacqueline de Ghent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EverAfter">Ever After</a></em> played by the lovely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelanieLynskey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelanieLynskey">Melanie Lynskey</a> is chided by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother">Wicked Stepmother</a> for eating too much and being overweight. The Baroness isn't at all a nice person, so cutting comments like that are to be expected, but no comment to the contrary is given, although <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the man she ends up with is the charming, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">snarky</a> captain of the guard and will probably eventually become Baroness de Ghent</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StripSearch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StripSearch">Strip Search</a></em>, an interrogator tells <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaggieGyllenhaal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaggieGyllenhaal">Maggie Gyllenhaal</a> she could stand to lose a few pounds. However, it's not clear what the character actually believes. He is an interrogator trying to break her will.
</li><li> Katie of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ParanormalActivity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ParanormalActivity">Paranormal Activity</a></em> is undeniably of a larger clothing size than a typical female Hollywood protagonist. Makes sense, since both Katie and Micah are supposed to be as average as possible to make the movie seem more real. Of course, after the movie's opening weekend, cue Internet discussions about Katie being so fat.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/NineMusical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/NineMusical">Nine</a></em>. Saraghina in the original film and musical is portrayed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulWoman">Big Beautiful Woman</a>. In Rob Marshall's film, she's played by Fergie. She apparently had to gain about seventeen pounds for the role (as did co-star Penelope Cruz) but it doesn't quite have the same effect.

The role was originally envisioned for Jack Black. There are a few shots that attempt to show that Pegg has something of a gut. In spite of the title they ultimately seem to go for "out of shape" rather than "fat." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that Pegg had just finished filming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotFuzz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotFuzz">Hot Fuzz</a></em> and had to be in superb shape to play Nicholas Angel. Quite difficult to put on a lot of weight that quickly.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrideWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrideWars">Bride Wars</a></em>, there's a scene that's pretty much lifted from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls">Mean Girls</a></em>, in which Kate Hudson's character is somehow tricked into eating five pounds worth of chocolate and can't fit into her wedding dress. In his <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUeTzkQQ0L0">[1]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of the movie, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BadMovieBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BadMovieBeatdown">Film Brain</a> points this out:
<div class="indent"> The whole "I'm fat" joke doesn't really work when you haven't really put any weight on. Oh, and I think Kate Hudson would actually look <em>healthier</em> if she put some weight on.
</div></li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathBecomesHer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathBecomesHer">Death Becomes Her</a></em>, when Madeline insults her husband by calling him overweight; said husband is played by Bruce Willis, and his "flab" is (at worst) a realistic middle-aged softness. However, this <em>is</em> in keeping with Madeline's character, as she's an <em>extremely</em> vain actress (and a rather hateful person to boot).
</li><li> Discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKingsSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKingsSpeech">The King's Speech</a></em> when Elizabeth complains to Bertie about how his brother's lover <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallisSimpson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallisSimpson">Wallis Simpson</a> calls her the "Fat Scottish Cook". Elizabeth is played by the petite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HelenaBonhamCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HelenaBonhamCarter">Helena Bonham-Carter</a>, and Simpson is portrayed as a horrible person, so it's apparently not meant to be taken seriously.
</li><li> Yancy from <em>Sleepover</em>, played by Kallie Flynn Childress. Yancy is picked on because of her weight several times over the course of the movie, although it's mostly from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a>. She also attracts the attention of a boy at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchoolDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchoolDance">High-School Dance</a>, establishing her as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulWoman">Big Beautiful Woman</a>.
</li><li> Margaret Dumont is constantly mocked for her weight by the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarxBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarxBrothers">Marx Brothers</a></em>. While consistently the largest women in the Marx films, and among the largest in period film, she's average for modern America and only slightly above normal for current actresses playing characters her age. Her height helped in the characterization, since all of the Marx brothers were fairly short and slender, making her look larger in comparison.
</li><li> Discussed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieMurphy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieMurphy">Eddie Murphy</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNuttyProfessor1996" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNuttyProfessor1996">The Nutty Professor (1996)</a></em> when Prof. Sherman Klump is having dinner with his family, much of whom, like Sherman, is obese.

Actress Melody Kay was quite visibly not overweight at <em>any</em> point during the movie; the filmmakers opted to put her in shapeless, frumpy clothes in the movie's first act (and having her act against Marnette Patterson, who was usually in painted-on outfits) to try justifying the claim.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMadnessOfKingGeorge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMadnessOfKingGeorge">The Madness of King George</a></em>, King George III and Queen Charlotte both gave their son, the Prince of Wales, a hard time about getting fat. In real life George IV was rather portly, but when portrayed by Rupert Everett, not so much.
</li><li> Played with on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DateNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DateNight">Date Night</a></em>. The girls in a sex club make noises of disgust when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TinaFey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TinaFey">Tina Fey</a> asks for a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.indielondon.co.uk/images/22636.jpg">size 8 costume<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.

It's not noticeable at all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/IntoTheWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/IntoTheWoods">Into the Woods</a></em>, Little Red Riding Hood is supposed to be quite plump, as repeatedly noted by the Wolf (and shown by the fact that she's constantly snitching food). While the original Broadway version cast the genuinely pudgy Danielle Ferland, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IntoTheWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IntoTheWoods">the Disney version</a> chose young actress Lilla Crawford, who has a round face but is in fact quite thin. It is mentioned that she ate half the bread and cakes that the bakers gave her for Granny, so the Wolf could be referring to water weight, but of course that isn't visible either.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFirstWivesClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFirstWivesClub">The First Wives Club</a></em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoursMineAndOurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoursMineAndOurs">Yours, Mine, and Ours</a></em> portrays Susan as a compulsive overeater, and she's said to be fat, but she is not noticeably any bigger than her siblings. When she loses weight, and Helen sends Frank a photo documenting her progress, there isn't much visible difference.

<ul><li> Andy, the protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDevilWearsPrada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDevilWearsPrada">The Devil Wears Prada</a></em>, gets an interview to work for <em>Runway</em> magazine. She attributes being even remotely considered for the job to the fact that she'd only just recovered from a severe gastrointestinal illness, and even at that she's still heavier than many of the other staff at the magazine. Subverted, however, in that none of her coworkers actually calls her fat - they actually assure her she's thin and gorgeous, while obsessing that <em>they're</em> overweight and hideous.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EtherOre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EtherOre">Ether Ore</a></em>, a tall young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">woman</a> who's said to be about 120 lbs is described as though her build is very solid and curvy - not fat, but far from skinny. A woman who's over 5'6" and weighs less than 120 lbs is almost always underweight. Somewhat justified in that the viewpoint character is a younger woman who's 90 lbs and boyish, so maybe it's just relative.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew">Nancy Drew</a> series, chum Bess is described as "pretty, but slightly plump", or in the 80s-to-90s era <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NancyDrewFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NancyDrewFiles">Nancy Drew Files</a>, as pretty, but perpetually obsessed with losing the five pounds she believes are standing between her and physical perfection. Despite this, she never has trouble attracting male attention. This is finally and thankfully subverted in the newest Nancy Drew series, <em>Nancy Drew: Girl Detective.</em> The closest mention of Bess's weight is the occasional throwaway line referring to a dress flattering her "curvy" figure.
</li><li> Lampshaded in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> series at one point, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">Vernon</a> describes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">Molly Weasley</a> as "dumpy." Harry thinks to himself that he has a bit of nerve commenting on Molly's weight, since Vernon's son, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Dudley</a>, has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard">become so fat</a> that his school doesn't even made uniforms in his size. (Molly also has the excuse of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveNumberedSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveNumberedSiblings">having seven children</a>.)
</li><li> Tris of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TamoraPierce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TamoraPierce">Tamora Pierce</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CircleOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CircleOfMagic">Circle of Magic</a></em> series is described as being chubby or plump. While this is very true in the text (she is frequently teased by unkind people), precisely zero of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie">book covers that feature her</a> show her as even a little bit chubby. At most, she's just wearing baggy clothes.
<ul><li> Kel of ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProtectorOfTheSmall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProtectorOfTheSmall">Protector of the Small</a>" doesn't fare much better: she's described as big in the books, and at one point bully character Joren tells her in a bit of 'concern trolling' that she'd be quite attractive if she lost some weight. But the nearest cover art comes to acknowledging this is not depicting her as an actual waif; she doesn't have the kind of figure on cover art that it would occur to even an enemy to pass negative comment upon.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Mad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Mad">MAD</a></em> played with the trope in their parody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Moonlighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Moonlighting">Moonlighting</a></em>. In their storyline, Maddie and Addison go undercover to investigate a circus. Maddie says she'll be the circus "fat lady." When Addison asks how that can be (because <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CybillShepherd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CybillShepherd">Cybill Shepherd</a></em>!), Maddie replies that "every girl thinks she's too fat."
</li><li> The protagonist of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielleSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielleSteel">Danielle Steel</a> novel <em>Big Girl</em> might be this. Despite her constant insecurities about her weight, it's mentioned that she's a size 12. While not thin, she's got a few more sizes to go before being considered fat or obese.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace">Will &amp; Grace</a></em>:
<ul><li> There's more than one episode in which Jack taunts Will for being a "fattie" or some similar disparagement. This is Eric McCormack we're talking about, here! Justified in that Jack is a neurotic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GymBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GymBunny">Gym Bunny</a> (who's so weight-conscious that he wears a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfCorsetsFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfCorsetsFunny">girdle</a> under his clothes) and he's the only one who says this about Will.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0b7q1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0b7q1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0b7q1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> It's also implied that deep down, Jack had feelings for Will.</span>
</li><li> Occasionally, Karen made similar jabs about Grace. In one episode, while decorating her mother's apartment, Karen warned her to "leave plenty of money in the budget for Egg McMuffins, 'cuz Heavy G like tah eat!" These, along with the jokes about Will, were usually played for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>, since it was painfully clear that neither Eric McCormack nor Debra Messing were overweight at all, and in fact Karen herself was rather voluptuous (and Messing was extremely thin: her flat-chestedness was a running gag, and one of her onscreen boyfriends described her as "awfully skinny", asking "don't you want to look a little...fatter?"). This became clear when several critics mentioned that the fat jokes leveled at Grace weren't funny anymore when Messing was pregnant.
</li><li> Another unfortunate case from the series is Karen's cousin <a class="urllink" href="http://willandgrace.wikia.com/wiki/Barry">Barry<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who receives a makeover from Will and Jack in Season 5. Pre-makeover, he has an average build and a rather thin face (hidden, respectively, behind baggy clothes and an unkempt beard). To hear Jack and Will talk, however, he's a whale — in fact, we're told they sent Barry to "fat camp" in the time between his first appearance and his second.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UglyBetty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UglyBetty">Ugly Betty</a></em>, as the title implies, featured America Ferrera as the titular "ugly" character who, in addition to braces and frumpy clothing, was often derided as fat by the fashion magazine she worked for. There's a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> to this, as in the fashion industry, "fat" = "having natural boobs and hips/being bigger than a size four." In real life, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imdb.com/media/rm4170748928/nm1065229">America Ferrera<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was at most a size 10, and thinner now, but you still get people on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDB">IMDB</a> boards calling her a bad role model for being obese. Of course, this <em>is</em> IMDb we're talking about here; most of the people on those boards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">live under bridges</a>.
<ul><li> <em>Ugly Betty</em> also had a woman everyone called "Fat Carol" who really wasn't, which was the whole point of the joke.
</li><li> For <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">Hypocritical Humor</a>, Amanda commonly jokes about how much Betty eats while chowing down on anything she sees.
</li><li> Ironically, in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YoSoyBettyLaFea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YoSoyBettyLaFea">Yo soy Betty, la fea</a></em> one of the points about the ugliness of Betty is that she is thin as a toothpick, and in an attempt to disguise that she ends wearing clothes better suited for her heavier mom. But then, they had the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eater</a> gossip hen Bertha, who was genuinely overweight (about US size 18, and when the actress - and her character - got pregnant, even bigger) but received a far less amount of fat jokes than a character of that type would receive, and all the remarks she got were from the vainest evil characters.
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirdRockFromTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirdRockFromTheSun">3rd Rock from the Sun</a></em>:
<ul><li> The world was being invaded by aliens disguised as supermodels, and Dr. Allbright was considered a larger woman for being a size 8.
</li><li> Again when Dick struggled with his weight for an episode. The ultimate solution: larger pants.
</li></ul></li><li> Rhoda Morgenstern on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMaryTylerMooreShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMaryTylerMooreShow">The Mary Tyler Moore Show</a></em> was considered fat, even though her build was scarcely different than Mary's. They would dress her in baggy outfits as opposed to Mary's more form fitting clothes, but no reasonable person would look at her and label her overweight.
<ul><li> This was finally inverted in a Season Three episode where Rhoda admits to having lost 20 pounds. Despite the constant compliments (even from Phyllis), she still can't see herself as attractive until she ends up winning her company's beauty contest.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">30 Rock</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one episode, Liz, who is regarded as frumpy in New York, meets a woman in Cleveland who asks her if she's a model and says "You are so skinny! You really should eat something."
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Liz</strong>: "And in Cleveland, I'm a model!"
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Jenna</strong>: "Yeah, we're all models west of the Allegheny."
</div><ul><li> The first few episodes of season two run this trope through the gamut. Jenna Maroney (played by the slender Jane Krakowski) plays the lead in a musical stage adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MysticPizza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MysticPizza">Mystic Pizza</a></em> over the summer, which requires her to eat thirty-two pieces of pizza a week. When she returns to television, she's gained weight in her stomach (and <em>only</em> her stomach—everything else looks exactly the same). Though she's heavier than before, she still looks gorgeous, but everyone treats her as though she's become monstrously obese. When she covers for a mistake in an sketch by shouting "ME WANT FOOD!," she's quickly turned into a caricature, with the writers giving her nothing but "fat woman" roles to play and NBC making T-shirts emblazoned with her new catchphrase. Eventually, Jenna embraces her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulWoman">Big Beautiful Woman</a> status, but only because it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">making people pay more attention to her</a>. She eventually loses the weight when Jack lampshades this trope, remarking, "She either needs to lose thirty pounds or gain sixty. There's no room for anything in between on television."
</li></ul></li><li> Many "jokes" about <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20031215063805/http://www.hard-to-find-actresses.com/content/pics/tr029.jpg">Carol's weight<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GrowingPains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GrowingPains">Growing Pains</a></em>, which certainly didn't help Tracey Gold's anorexia any.
</li><li> A lot was made of Sara Rue being a "full figured" woman on her ABC sitcom <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LessThanPerfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LessThanPerfect">Less Than Perfect</a></em>; indeed, the show's title was supposedly in reference to Rue's character's appearance. In reality, of course, Rue was a mildly zaftig size 12, and gorgeous as hell. Unfortunately, the press got to her, and she went on a crash diet that backfired horribly, leaving her needing to join Jenny Craig just to get back to about her <em>Less than Perfect</em> size.
</li><li> If this hadn't been averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Huge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Huge">Huge</a></em>, the show would have been a crowning example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint">Comically Missing the Point</a>. Thankfully all the fat characters were played by larger individuals and the body image aesop remained unbroken.
</li><li> Harriet Olson is the butt of several fat jokes on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleHouseOnThePrairie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleHouseOnThePrairie">Little House on the Prairie</a></em>, though multiple episodes feature larger characters to teach us that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">fat people have feelings, too</a>.
</li><li> Ethel Mertz of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveLucy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveLucy">I Love Lucy</a></em> fame, called a "fat old bag" by her husband, despite Vivian Vance not being noticeably heavier than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucilleBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucilleBall">Lucille Ball</a>. When casting the role, they deliberately cast a thin woman, since a husband calling his thin wife "fat" is funny, while a husband calling his fat wife fat makes you feel sympathy for her. In later seasons, Vivian Vance gained some weight, changing the dynamic. It got so bad that an <a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/vance.asp">Urban Legend<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> sprang up claiming that she was contractually obligated to remain 20 pounds overweight. Ironically, she became a star by playing sexy vamps in Cole Porter musicals on Broadway. She was a <em><a class="urllink" href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/59/186927453_b5df3e6e8b.jpg">knockout<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small></em>!
<ul><li> In one episode, Lucy goes on a crash diet so she can fit into a costume (made for a thin dancer) and sneak into an act of Ricky's show. She loses so much weight that she has to go to the <em>hospital</em> once the show is over. (And it's all played for laughs, of course.)
</li></ul></li><li> Peggy Olson of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen">Mad Men</a></em> gains weight throughout Season One. We're led to believe it's because she's trying to avoid being treated as a sex object at work - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it's actually because she's pregnant</span>.
</li><li> Rodney McKay of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em> is occasionally referred to as fat by other characters, and frequently in fanfic and discussion, and he typically can't keep up with other characters in their running, jumping, and climbing up trees. To be fair, he does show noticeable "wattle", and most of those he interacts with on Atlantis are in prime physical condition, either being USAF or alien <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldiers</a>.
<ul><li> This is lampshaded in "The Tao of Rodney" when Ronon comments (behind Rodney's back) that he looks like he's gained weight; Rodney overhears and makes a point of announcing to everyone that he is the same weight he's always been.
</li></ul></li><li> Invoked, possibly, on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KeepingUpWithTheKardashians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KeepingUpWithTheKardashians">Keeping Up with the Kardashians</a></em>, when Kourtney tries to get <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Khloe_Kardashian_2009.jpg">Khloe<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> to stop reading blogs that refer to her as a "whale," stating that the people making the criticisms are probably overweight themselves. Shortly thereafter, the audience is treated to Khloe in a miniskirt and heels.
</li><li> Occurs accidentally in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder">Blackadder the Third</a></em>, where several people describe Prince George as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">fat</a> The <strong>historical</strong> Prince George was actually fat, but here he's played by the tall and lanky <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughLaurie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughLaurie">Hugh Laurie</a>, so the insults just seem to come out of nowhere. Which of course just serves to make it even funnier.
</li><li> Definitely played for comedy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bottom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bottom">Bottom</a></em> (especially in the live shows), where Richie is apparently monstrously obese.
</li><li> This is used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AbsolutelyFabulous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AbsolutelyFabulous">Absolutely Fabulous</a></em>, where the entire cast describes Eddie as being "fat" (including Eddie herself), when she's in fact completely average. It isn't clear whether the writers were trying to garner a few laughs from the ridiculousness of it, or lampooning thin people who <em>think</em> they're fat. Possibly Justified, as Eddie works in the fashion industry where yes, she <em>would</em> be considered fat.
<ul><li> This is part of some pretty cruel humour involving the shallow, neurotic Patsy, played by the tall and slender Joanna Lumley, who is obsessive about weight and body image and clearly shown to be a drug addict as well.
<ul><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FrenchAndSaunders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FrenchAndSaunders">French and Saunders</a></em> where Saunders makes fun of the definitely dumpy Dawn French, describing her own figure as "tall and womanly"
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Averted and played with throughout <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GavinAndStacey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GavinAndStacey">Gavin &amp; Stacey</a></em> in which Ruth Jones' character Nessa is distinctly overweight, in a BBW sort of way - but averted by the character being a fairly OTT comic grotesque. It's also heavily implied that she is a vigorous, passionate woman in bed. Nessa's on-off partner Smithy (James Corden) is plain fat by any standards, and there is a running subtext about how no-one can really understand what either saw in the other.
<ul><li> Ignored with Alison Steadman's character, who is portrayed as an attractive middle-aged woman.
</li></ul></li><li> On a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JustShootMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JustShootMe">Just Shoot Me!</a></em> episode where one of Nina's former colleagues shows up having gained considerable weight. When Nina finally confronts her with this, she says she has no problem with her weight and actually worries about how Nina is still so obsessed with looks after so many years.
<ul><li> Also played with: Maya is thin, but since she works at a fashion magazine her colleagues don't typically think of her that way.
<ul><li> Discussed in one episode, she dates a man who likes bigger women. She enjoys eating what she wants and not exercising, until sees his ex, who's considerably overweight (although well dressed and groomed), and realizes the man is fattening her up. He then tries to convince her to gain weight for him ("Come on, fifty pounds and I'll buy the stretch pants!"). She points out that trying to make a person change to be fatter is just as negatively critical and psychologically detrimental as trying to force the person to be thin.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em>The New York Times</em> had <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/22/health/22well.html">an article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on the Lifetime series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DropDeadDiva" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DropDeadDiva">Drop Dead Diva</a></em> praising it for having a realistic attitude towards women's weight, but accompanying it with a picture in which the "fat" protagonist is obviously, by any realistic standard, not fat, and right next to her is Margaret Cho, who has been the epitome of the "fat Asian" caricature. Uh huh....
<ul><li> This can be justified (in-show, at least) with the series' protagonist, as she was formerly a <em>very</em> petite aspiring model. Not so much with Margaret Cho, however.
</li></ul></li><li> Al from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement">Home Improvement</a></em> is a male pseudo-example. He's only moderately overweight by real world standards, but in the show people talk about him as if he were morbidly obese, with all the behaviors that would go with it. The teasing mostly just comes from Tim, but the show also utilizes prop gags at his weight's expense. For example, Tim had invented a reverse laundry chute and sent a pair of Al's boxers up it to Jill, who unfolded them. They would've fit a sumo. Cue the laughtrack. Poor Richard Karn is the poster child for the idea that the camera adds 30 lbs. In real life, he's got a moderately stocky frame but not even the suggestion of a gut.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesperateHousewives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesperateHousewives">Desperate Housewives</a></em>:
<ul><li> In season 5, a great deal is made of Gaby becoming "fat and frumpy" after losing her wealth and giving birth to two children. The costume department nailed the "frumpy" part, but even with an unflattering wardrobe (and light padding), it was painfully obvious that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EvaLongoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EvaLongoria">Eva Longoria</a> was <a class="urllink" href="http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110918104703/desperate/images/d/de/GabrielleS5.png">no heavier<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> than in the previous seasons.
</li><li> Another episode featured a number of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf">What If?</a>" sequences, including one where Susan gains weight due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartbreakAndIceCream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartbreakAndIceCream">comfort eating</a> (for which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TeriHatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TeriHatcher">Teri Hatcher</a> wore a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatSuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatSuit">Fat Suit</a>). A number of writers commented that Teri actually looked <em><a class="urllink" href="http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-01-05/entertainment/17945369_1_teri-hatcher-plane-crash-desperate-housewives">better<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> with a realistic middle-aged "softness" than as her usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodThin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodThin">Hollywood Thin</a> self.
</li></ul></li><li> Eli on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Stargate Universe</a></em> is treated as if he's obese; in fact, he's at most slightly overweight for his height.
</li><li> In the glory days of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YouCantDoThatOnTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YouCantDoThatOnTelevision">You Can't Do That on Television</a></em>, the show's host, Christine McGlade, and her cohort, Lisa Ruddy, would constantly taunt each other as being "fat." While a case can kind of be made for the <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090211203020/http://www.ycdtotv.com/cast/index.php?p=ruddy">slightly chubby Lisa<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> at the time, <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090211203010/http://www.ycdtotv.com/cast/index.php?p=mcglade">Christine can hardly have been described as having a weight problem<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one early episode, the gang comments that already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely">Hollywood Homely</a> Chandler has put on weight—Phoebe even mockingly pretends that she can't put her arms around him to give him a hug and Monica spends the episode putting him through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> to lose weight. In reality, Chandler was played by the thin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewPerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewPerry">Matthew Perry</a> and had no weight gain at all. This episode becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">Harsher in Hindsight</a> due to later seasons seeing Matthew Perry's weight genuinely fluctuating due to his rehab battles with addictions that stemmed from an accident he was in that occurred some time after this episode.
</li><li> The "Fat Monica" flashbacks are also an example of this. While Monica <em>is</em> overweight, she <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140315055810/http://i.ytimg.com/vi/zsXqii1rH1Q/0.jpg">clearly isn't as large<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> as the show makes her out to be. (Certainly not enough to "break a porch swing" or "be mistaken for an Alp".) This is partly due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>, as with Monica's fat years being the 80s, she would have been seen as obese. Back then the percentage of obese Americans was just 11%, so while modern viewers see Monica as being just slightly overweight given the current standards, she was genuinely seen as being quite large back then.
</li></ul></li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Undeclared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Undeclared">Undeclared</a></em>, the character played by the extremely not-fat Monica Keena is portrayed as eating so much and getting so fat (i.e. wearing looser clothes) that her friends even stage an intervention. It isn't until two nerds start hitting on her that she realizes she must be extremely unattractive if they think she is in their league. She swears to never eat a carb again and gets back to being very thin (i.e. tighter clothes again) by the end of the episode and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNerd">Hollywood Nerd</a> doesn't dare to hit on her anymore.
<ul><li> Note that in the real world, being gorgeous is <em>not</em> a very effective way to repel nerds.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyLittleLiars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyLittleLiars">Pretty Little Liars</a></em>, Hanna is supposed to have been fat a year before. But in the flashbacks early in the show... she's played by the same actress wearing <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140901154110/http://www.youknowyoulovefashion.com/storage/prettylittleliars/season2/0218/0218hanna7.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1328162665158">frumpy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140714030047/http://www.youknowyoulovefashion.com/storage/prettylittleliars/season1/0112/0112Hanna4.jpg">baggy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> clothing. As the show progressed, the costumers and makeup artists got much better about depicting Hanna as having been fat in the flashbacks, but even then, she still looks like a fairly average-figured girl with <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140901154023/http://www.youknowyoulovefashion.com/storage/prettylittleliars/season1/0118/0118_Hanna16.jpg">unfortunately sized clothing<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> and what looks to be a pillow stuffed down her shirt.
</li><li> Often used on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls">The Golden Girls</a></em>, in which Blanche and Rose are frequently the target of barbs about their weight, even though they look exactly the way two middle-aged women who have had several children should look. Though Rose gets to subvert that in the episode where the four women engage in an impromptu dance-off, where Rose does a pretty fantastic job dancing <em>topped off by doing a badass split on the floor</em>. And Blanche? Well, there must be a reason why she's portrayed as being the siren of the foursome, the woman all the (silver-haired) guys want and with a little black book to rival any femme fatale's.
</li><li> Insinuated in the appropriately-titled episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em> "The Non-Fat Yogurt," where Kramer quite rudely comments that Jerry and Elaine have put on weight (due to eating supposedly fat-free yogurt that in fact <em>does</em> contain fat). Later, Elaine's current date appears to develop an aversion towards her due to her (alleged) weight gain. One would think they had become morbidly obese overnight due to the reactions of others around them, instead of experiencing a normal fluctuation in size. Elaine's supposed "weight gain" in that episode is not even made to be in the least bit noticeable. However, Elaine alludes to an incident where she supposedly sat on a chair and it broke due to her weight. Unless the chair was made of balsa wood, such a scenario would be have been highly unlikely.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas">Total Divas</a></em> references this a few times:
<ul><li> "The Fat Twin" has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BellaTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BellaTwins">Nikki Bella</a> discovering a fan calling her fat on Instagram, and she spends the episode getting fat-shamed by Brie. Likewise Brie panics before a photoshoot and tries to do a thirty-day juice cleanse - essentially drinking nothing but juice for a month. Nikki has said in interviews that she is naturally much bigger than Brie and had to do daily ab and cardio workouts to match her sister's body type.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EvaMarie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EvaMarie">Eva Marie</a> frets about a photoshoot after being injured for a while, and goes crazy in the gym trying to lose weight.

<ul><li> The lanky, rail-thin Portia de Rossi, playing Lindsay Bluth, is constantly criticized for being fat by her mother, Lucille Bluth, and keeps referring to as eating enormous quantities. Quite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">Harsher in Hindsight</a> when de Rossi revealed her battles with anorexia. Of course this is very clearly just Lucille being a terrible, hyper-critical mother; no one else ever refers to this.
</li><li> Buster is also occasionally referred to as fat by Anyong and other kids, despite quite possibly being the tallest and thinnest of the Bluths. Presumably, this is just childish meanness.
</li><li> Ann also gets a bit of this along with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely">Hollywood Homely</a> jokes.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KirstieAlley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KirstieAlley">Kirstie Alley</a> — whose weight has famously fluctuated between nearly-emaciated to clearly obese, finally settling on the high side of zaftig — has famously criticized this phenomenon, both in a notorious appearance in a swimsuit on <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Oprah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Oprah">Oprah</a></em>, and in her brutally satirical and quasi-biographical Showtime series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatActress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatActress">Fat Actress</a></em>. Tellingly, the series only lasted a single season, and she has since started trying again to lose weight. Notable here, as she's receive a mountain of criticism, if not outright insults, from Oprah, other celebs, and fashion industry gossip mags even when she was down to a normal weight. Some of these comments, such as Leah Remini referring to herself as "Kirstie Alley fat" are examined on the series. While it's all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CringeComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CringeComedy">Cringe Comedy</a> can be hard to watch.
</li><li> Trudi Malloy on <em>Mistresses</em> comments on how she needs to go on a diet and "my rear end <em>wobbles</em> when I walk!" Not only is Trudi played by the positively stunning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SharonSmall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SharonSmall">Sharon Small</a>, she looks like <a class="urllink" href="http://i986.photobucket.com/albums/ae341/curearainyday/sharon.jpg">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> on the show.

</li><li> Parodied in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnhappilyEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnhappilyEverAfter">Unhappily Ever After</a></em>. Ryan tampers with the bathroom scale to read an additional ten pounds, to make Tiffany think she has gained weight (largely, she thinks, to a recent zit), to her horror. Jack doesn't approve of this until Jennie weighs herself and freaks out as well. Both women struggle to lose the imaginary weight, despite not looking any different before the tampering.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>:
<ul><li> Finn is nervous about playing Brad in the Glee club's performance of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRockyHorrorPictureShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRockyHorrorPictureShow">The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a></em>, where he'd have to strip to his underwear. But then we actually see him in his underwear, and it's hard to picture anyone kicking him out of bed. His "weight problem" is a running gag on the show.
</li><li> To some extent, Rachel. In the first season, her character is said to be chubby and is teased by mean girls. In the second season, she herself mentioned she had some "baby fat". Rachel is played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeaMichele" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeaMichele">Lea Michele</a>, who has <em>always</em> been skinny. The actress however, did become noticeably skinnier after the first season. <a class="urllink" href="http://showthemwhat.tumblr.com/post/9147008224/berrystyle-rachel-berrys-glee-outfits-episode">Season One<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> vs <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wetpaint.com/glee/articles/the-scoop-on-loser-like-me-and-get-it-right-adam-anders-details-glees-original-songs">Season Two<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Karofsky, called "chubby" and "Manimal" by Kurt and Artie, is certainly heavier than the rest of the principal guys on the show, but is noticeably slimmer than other members of the football team. Max Adler just seems to be naturally huskier than the other cast members. Besides, he's a lineman, he's <em>supposed</em> to be bulky and that most of that bulk is muscle is shown in the locker room fight with Sam, Mike and Artie.
<ul><li> It becomes an "issue of the week" in Season 4, when Mean Girl Kitty taunts Marley about having "the fat gene." Marley's mother is very overweight, but it becomes ridiculous when Kitty starts taking in Marley's stage costumes and Marley develops an eating disorder, despite her other clothes and the scale not changing at all. The actress who plays Marley has visible hip and collar bones.
</li></ul></li><li> An example in Season 4, episode one, also a pretty cruel subversion. Cassandra July berates her class by telling them "If you don't have body dysmorphic disorder, you don't want (success) badly enough." And then she pulls over a student, calling her "Muffin Top" and tells her "it's rice cakes and ipecac, or cut off a butt cheek, because you need to drop a few." The student is played by an actress with visible collar bones.
<ul><li> Amusingly, Muffin Top is actually explicitly credited in the script as "Normal Sized Female Student"
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LasVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LasVegas">Las Vegas</a></em> had a rather grating example of this in the season 5's episode "Three Babes, 100 Guns, and a Fat Chick" with the downright skinny Danny McCoy (Josh Duhamel) and Delinda Deline (Molly Sims), where both characters were repeatedly derided for their sudden weight gains. Delinda was simply pregnant so it's obvious she'd naturally gain a pregnancy belly, but even in this state she looked surprisingly thin. The lightly-build Danny seemingly had a bit of padding tucked underneath his shirt coupled with a suit jacket that's obviously too tiny even for his build, both of which were completely gone by the next episode. Both characters were suddenly treated as if they were grossly overweight.
</li><li> Averted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MikeAndMolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MikeAndMolly">Mike &amp; Molly</a></em>. Victoria Flynn, played by Hollywood Pudgy Katy Mixon, is the sexpot character who always wears revealing outfits and gets lots of dates, with no mention (at least so far) of her weight or whether or not she should be considered hot because of it.
</li><li> Isabelle on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Weeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Weeds">Weeds</a></em> is at most very slightly pudgy and that could be because of the way the show dresses her but she is a plus-sized children's model in the show and her admittedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> mother acts as if she's two or three hundred pounds.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow">The Cosby Show</a></em> had Claire frantically trying to lose several pounds to fit into a fancy dress. She's shocked at the realization that she even needs to lose weight (though her husband Cliff smugly enjoys this, given the way she's always haranguing him about HIS eating habits), and ridiculed by her aerobics instructor, even though Claire is noticeably slimmer than many of the other women in the class.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy">Grey's Anatomy</a></em>, Chyler Leigh's (Lexie) real-life weight gain due to pregnancy was rather ham-fistedly written into the plot: the very thin Lexie was made a stress-eater kind of out of nowhere and began wolfing down snacks when Mark and Derek were in a long fight. Meredith referred to her ass as being "huge," which it really wasn't, but at least they kept up the storyline and brought in back in season seven, when Mark tells Jackson to ply her with peanut butter cups to get her to talk about her feelings.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia">It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dee's mother constantly insinuates that Dee is fat, even though Kaitlin Olsen is quite lanky and slender. Her mother, however, is a horrible person.
</li><li> Dee insinuates that the vain and athletic Dennis is putting on weight. He freaks out and begins starving himself. When he seems close to death, she finally admits that she was just messing with him, because he's a horrible person.
</li><li> The trope was later famously inverted by Rob McElhenney, who, prior to the seventh season of the show, deliberately gained fifty pounds of fat (though he did also exercise to generally bulk up his body) to combat the trend of actors becoming more attractive as their shows become more successful. Within the season, Rob's character Mac <em>thinks</em> of himself as a now-muscular bodybuilder who's considerably beefed up...but he's really just plain fat.
</li></ul></li><li> A male example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigWolfOnCampus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigWolfOnCampus">Big Wolf on Campus</a></em>. Tommy's enhanced appetite starts getting the best of him in "The Wolf Is Out There" and he begins gaining weight, although he simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalloonBelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalloonBelly">developed a noticeable belly</a> rather than becoming huge. He manages to lose the weight by the end of the episode through dieting and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>. The viewers complained that they didn't understand why people were treating Tommy differently, considering he's a football player and they tend to bulk up. Even better, he was bulking up as a wolf-like reaction, since most animals will gain some extra girth during the winter. Not only do humans generally do the same thing (often called holiday weight,) so do football players! Since winter is the off-season for football players, many will lighten their exercise regimen and pad out a little.
<ul><li> It's especially bizarre considering that two of the people calling him fat are his football teammates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">Tim and Travis</a>, who are themselves prime examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFun">Big Fun</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoutStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoutStrength">Stout Strength</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Mellie of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse">Dollhouse</a></em> is played as being the heavy, homely neighbor-with-a-crush. It doesn't help that most of the other female characters are dolls, specifically chosen in-universe to be gorgeous and sexy, but one doubts that most people who like women would kick her out of bed....
<ul><li> Mellie <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>is</em> a doll as revealed later in the series, so she's chosen <em>in-universe</em> to be <em>gorgeous and sexy</em>.</span>
</li><li> No one besides Mellie herself considers to be overweight or in any way unattractive. She's played less as the heavy, homely neighbour, and more as the Betty to Echo's Veronica - the sweet, pretty next-door neighbour as opposed to the beautiful, dangerous Doll. At least at first.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatsSoRaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatsSoRaven">That's So Raven</a></em> actually deconstructed this trope in one episode. Raven (portrayed by the curvy Raven Symone) is told she isn't skinny enough to model the clothes she designed for a fashion show. She and the twig-thin model then team up and both wear the outfit on the runway. Also deconstructed when both of them chew out the magazine owner that's sponsoring the show, saying that no one is as skinny as they look on the magazine.
<div class="indent"><strong>Raven:</strong> Nobody looks like that!

The actress playing the role was a shocking! 50! kilos! (i.e. 110 lbs).

</li><li> Christopher Tietjens in the British miniseries adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParadesEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParadesEnd">Parade's End</a></em> certainly qualifies. In the book, Tietjens is always being described as fat while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenedictCumberbatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenedictCumberbatch">Benedict Cumberbatch</a> isn't at all. They gave the naturally slim actor a fat suit and cheek plumpers, but he just ended up looking like he was of an average weight.
</li><li> Retroactively done on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em>. A first season episode revolves around Turk having recently put on a bit of weight (as a surgical intern with limited free time is apt to do). Carla and J.D. taunt Him for it and he asks Dr. Cox for fitness advice. It ends with Turk resolving not to worry about his weight. Irritatingly, however, Turk is later described by Cox as having been "a fat load", which Turk seems to agree with, even though his appearance has barely changed in the four years between episodes.
<ul><li> Elliot's mother would often tease her about supposedly getting fat even though Dr. Cox and Jordan have made it abundantly clear that if anything, she's actually underweight. It is established however, that her mother is a very horrible person, and may also explain why, for years, Elliot was such a neurotic mess.

</li><li> A non-human example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwoBrokeGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwoBrokeGirls">2 Broke Girls</a></em>: in "And The Reality Check," a stable-owner tells Caroline that her horse Chestnut is out of shape. That would be perfectly realistic, of course, since Chestnut had been living in Max's tiny backyard and had not been getting proper exercise. The problem is that the horse who plays Chestnut is, of course, very well cared for and is in great shape.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFreshPrinceOfBelAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFreshPrinceOfBelAir">The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</a></em>:
<ul><li> Uncle Phil is subject to hundreds of fat jokes throughout the entire series, particularly by Will and Geoffrey. While he is quite a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eater</a>, they almost always make him out as morbidly obese. It's also made clear that much of his bulk is also muscle and he could snap most people in half if he wanted (which is also true of his actor, former Navy man James Avery).

Although he hits it off with her and clearly enjoys being with her, he can't get over his hang-ups about her weight. While she's certainly zaftig, she's not obese or even overweight and completely undeserving of the nasty comments leveled at her by several of Will's friends — "I bet she's <em>tons</em> of fun.", "Two pizzas?

There is always the "curvy" girl that everyone treats as hideously overweight. In reality, those girls are <em>maybe</em> average weight. Maybe.
<ul><li> Particular notice of one girl, who got told "Look, you entered this as a plus-sized model, and you've lost weight. Either you gain it back, or you lose enough to compete with the other models." by Tyra.
</li><li> This came to a head during the season where the "plus-sized" girl actually won. Many people felt it was disingenuous of <em>Top Model</em> to continually praise themselves for crowning a "plus-size model" when the girl in question, Whitney, barely looked heavier than the rest of the girls. <a class="urllink" href="http://images2.fanpop.com/images/photos/6200000/ANTM-Whitney-whitney-thompson-6256483-500-752.jpg">A comparison of her and the runner up.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>
<ul><li> It's also true that in the high fashion world, she would actually be considered plus-sized. In one of the episodes, the girls were supposed to find a fashion sponsor or something, and at least two told this girl that they did not carry her size. In another season, there were two plus-sized models, and often the clothing selected for them were quite ill-fitted for curvy women, causing commentary about how "big" the girls were.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Parodied on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSuiteLifeOfZackAndCody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSuiteLifeOfZackAndCody">The Suite Life of Zack and Cody</a></em> when London and Maddie were led to believe by a rude friend of the former that they were too fat and too thin respectively. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrendaSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrendaSong">Brenda Song</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AshleyTisdale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AshleyTisdale">Ashley Tisdale</a> were quite thin at the time, but not dangerously so; London could have endangered her health with a crash diet and compulsive exercise, while Maddie had no reason to binge and could have set herself on the path to obesity. Moseby tried to talk some sense into them, telling them what anyone who isn't brainwashed by this trope (and its inverse) already knew: they're both gorgeous and don't need other people to tell them what to look like; it doesnt sink in until a certain amount of time later, where London is on the verge of passing out from lack of food, and Maddie is so bloated from constantly gorging that she cant fit in her dress (with no actual prosthetics to show any such weight gain).
</li><li> Raj from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em> is very critical of his own physique, which, at worst, is a little doughy in the middle. It does, however, tie in with his girly tendencies.
</li><li> On the fifth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RuPaulsDragRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RuPaulsDragRace">RuPaul's Drag Race</a></em>, finalist Roxxxy Andrews kept referring to herself as a "big girl". While she may have been overweight in the past, on the show Roxxxy looked like an average man out of drag, and in drag she was curvy but not fat, especially compared to previous contestants who were considerably heavier. Since she lost over 70 pounds before the show, why she was so eager to take that label is a mystery.
</li><li> An MTV pilot about sorority life, entitled, quite creatively, <em>Sorority</em>, featured a house that had a weight requirement. The crux of the pilot is that the sorority accepted the main character, but rejected her best friend based on the weight requirement (she was stated at 105 pounds...and actually looked <em>thinner</em> than the main character!) The sorority also features a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eater</a> sister who keeps the weight off by purging.

Granted that they might be a bit heavy by the standards of professional dancers by any other standards they're both knockouts. Plus, since, as working dancers, they're in a constant state of exercise it's more likely that their "overwieght" is a case of heavy bone structure and/or being (for dancers) overmuscled.
<ul><li> By the standards of the ballroom/Latin world, which is less fixated on a hyper-thin look than ballet (especially Latin and American Rhythm, where if you don't have curves, your costumes add them for you), neither is notably heavy at all. By television standards, they fit this trope to a tee — many professional ballroom dancers, despite being insanely fit, would be considered the "pudgy best friend" type at best in Hollywood.

The end of the episode involves everyone telling Topanga she's not fat and Mr. Feeny delivering the aesop about living in a world of unreasonable standards. This episode apparently came into existence because the press flipped out about Danielle Fishel's very slight weight gain during the run of the show (basically, she went from a skinny pre-teen to a curvy adult.) On the other hand, the other characters act as though Topanga was developing an eating disorder when she never did anything more radical than try to stop eating junkfood.

This borders on body dysmorphic disorder, as not only is she not fat, for all their relentless teasing of her, none of the other cast members tease her about her weight.
</li><li> Jewel Staite was asked to gain a few pounds to play Kaylee in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em> to look like 'the kind of girl who enjoys a burger once in a while'.

She panics at the thought of being seen in a swimsuit and decides to lose weight by skipping all of her meals and overexercising at the gym, to the point of nearly passing out. Candace Cameron did have a somewhat round face as a preteen, which is to be expected before going through puberty, but she was definitely not fat, or even overweight, by any standard. It's somewhat lampshaded in-universe, with her family pointing out that she doesn't need to lose weight and that her friends like her because she's a kind, nice person, not for her size. It doesn't help that Andrea Barber, who played Kimmy, was quite lanky and often given form-fitting clothing as costumes—<em>anyone</em> would have looked heavier standing next to her.

Even Murr, the trimmest and fittest of the four, got this treatment in one episode after he had apparently gained a couple of pounds.

Interestingly, fanart often does make Aziraphale <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulMan">attractively chubby</a>, probably for more visual contrast with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodlePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodlePeople">Crowley</a>.

This didn't stop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus">Trish Stratus</a> from making fun of her, though - and she was supposed to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">face</a>. It was mostly played for comedy, considering Molly was a heel at the time. In her shoot interview, she talked about how depressed she got during this time period. She claims she initially okayed the idea, finding the jokes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny">Actually Pretty Funny</a> - but they got old really fast. Making it more uncomfortable was the 2019 revelation that she'd been battling an eating disorder while she was on the road (an addiction to processed sugar to be specific).
</li><li> A similar angle started in 2009 and carried over into 2010, this time featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickieJames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickieJames">Mickie James</a> (a face) in the role of the Hollywood Pudgy gal while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LayCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LayCool">Michelle McCool and Layla El</a> (heels) ripped on her for being fat, even going so far as to give her the nickname "Piggie James". Mickie would give a speech about how all women were beautiful - which also mercifully avoided the back-handed thin shaming that usually comes with such a thing.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CandiceMichelle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CandiceMichelle">Candice Michelle</a> was attacked by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/DivaDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/DivaDirt">Diva Dirt</a></em> for being "out of shape" and "tubby" when she was in the middle of rehabbing several injuries, and therefore immobile. <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090130212429/http://24wrestling.com:80/imagery/index.php?gal=99">This<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is Candice's "Fat Picture". Thud.
</li><li> Although she later stated it wasn't the case, a big rumor on the internet was that WWE Diva Cherry (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KaraDrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KaraDrew">Kara Drew</a>) was fired for being overweight.
</li><li> In a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">twist</a>, some fans tend to rag on male wrestlers if they gain a bit of softness around the middle. On the one hand, when your ring attire consists of tights, trunks, spandex or a bathing suit, any bit of chubbiness will be more noticeable can turn to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice">Fan Disservice</a>. On the other hand, it sure as heck can't <em>help</em> wrestling's ongoing steroid problem. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattHardy">Matt Hardy</a> has become a particular target of this after he gained weight following a burst appendix that wrecked his digestive system. It didn't help his cause though when in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> video he was seen eating steak fries and still has a large belly two years after his injury. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150096847136026&amp;set=a.10150096845871026.282233.31695961025&amp;theater#!/photo.php?fbid=10150096846841026&amp;set=a.10150096845871026.282233.31695961025&amp;theater&amp;pid=6433567&amp;id=31695961025">This is Matt Hardy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> recently. Either some of the barbs about him are supposed to be ironic, calling him fat has become some kind of bizarre affectionate nickname like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TeddyLong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TeddyLong">Teddy Long</a>'s "Peanuthead", or the idea of this trope being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale">Always Female</a> double standard is officially dead.
</li><li> In an odd aversion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamoaJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamoaJoe">Samoa Joe</a> who actually is big, doesn't get any crap from people (Well <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottSteiner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottSteiner">Scott</a> "HE'S FAT!!!" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottSteiner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottSteiner">Steiner</a> called him fat, but he's legitimately nuts), probably because he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Acrofatic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Acrofatic">Acrofatic</a> and a hell of a wrestler. Samoan wrestlers have historically been quite "stout"; then again, most of them come from one family. Joe is an exception, but the cruiserweight-shaped <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUsos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUsos">Usos</a> aren't, however.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VickieGuerrero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VickieGuerrero">Vickie Guerrero</a> had a lot of fat jokes hurled at her after she gained weight. Although she lost the weight in 2010, there would still be the occasional segment where she was mocked for it - particularly by faces who were supposed to be role models. WWE seemed to realise their mistake and dropped the jokes - portraying Vickie as a cougar instead and even having her compete in a swimsuit battle royal (that was not portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice">Fan Disservice</a> either).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MariaKanellis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MariaKanellis">Maria Kanellis</a> has said that when she was first in WWE, she was told she was too fat. Back in the Diva Era, the women were frequently told to lose weight. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RosaMendes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RosaMendes">Rosa Mendes</a> likewise - who has never been anything resembling fat - was told to.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BellaTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BellaTwins">Nikki Bella</a> who has never been anything remotely resembling overweight, was highly offended on episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas">Total Divas</a></em> when someone referred to her as "the fat twin" on Instagram. It got even worse when Brie noted how much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eater</a> her sister was and got paranoid about an upcoming photoshoot. She attempted to get her sister to do a ridiculous magazine cleanse - having nothing but juice for 20 days - and calling her fat thinking "tough love" would motivate her sister. Instead she gave a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">Moment of Awesome</a> speech on how the two of them both look fine and don't need to put their bodies through so much hell for the sake of 3 or 4 pounds.
</li><li> In 2012, Irish Airborne Dave and Jake Crist teamed up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamiCallihan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamiCallihan">Sami Callihan</a> to form Ohio Is For Killers in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CZW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CZW">CZW</a>. While the CZW fans loved this and began to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crowdchant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crowdchant">chant</a> "OI4K" whenever they showed up, some other fans of the Crists <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">weren't too happy</a> and started calling them "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickName">Oink</a>" based on the perception they had gotten fatter and degenerated into being skewered for a living. <em>Technically</em> true but <a class="urllink" href="http://www.czwrestling.com/lockerroom/oi4k.php">grossly overstated<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, as they still didn't look fat.
</li><li> While not to the degree of Matt Hardy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisHero">Chris Hero</a> was the subject of many fat jokes after he got released from WWE, a persistent rumor being that he was at first taken off NXT shows due to a lack of devotion to physical conditioning. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DragonGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DragonGate">Dragon Gate</a> USA, Trent Baretta insisted Chris Hero would have been headlining WWE with Kings Of Wrestling partner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ClaudioCastagnoli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ClaudioCastagnoli">Claudio Castagnoli</a> if he had only eaten a salad. Well, he has a page here. You take a look at Hero why don'tchu? Even if he was taken off of NXT for weight issues, he looked exactly the same as he always did when they let him back on and at the time of his release, which was unrelated. No really, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wrestlecrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ohno.jpg">this is Chris Hero<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> "fat". Ironically, there was much less noise when he actually did get pudgy in 2015, possibly because it still didn't stop him wrestling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">three hours at SMASH to raise money for ALS treatment.</a>
</li><li> Speaking of Dragon Gate, Punch Tominaga's softer physique is often the subject of derision from his enemies, as the company deals almost exclusively in handsome, lean fitness fanatics. Mondai Ryu was heavier for some time, and much was made of that, too. Jimmy Kanda's weight and size are never pointed out, though, despite his being the least aesthetically built guy on the roster.
</li><li> Rich Swann and Jessicka Havok <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouFightLikeACow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouFightLikeACow">threw these weight and diet jokes at each other in an attempt to gain an edge</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllysinKay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllysinKay">Allysin Kay</a> called Havok fat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">when declaring she had no more use for her.</a> For the record, all three looked perfectly fine...though years after the fact Havok would go through what fans called a "Chris Hero phase".
</li><li> During the Pure Wrestling Association <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">Carrot Cup</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LondonAndKendrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LondonAndKendrick">London and Kendrick</a> were announced as having a total combined weight of 3000 lbs.
</li><li> Another male example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting">Sting</a>. Six-foot-three and in better shape than most men half his age gained some happy weight before coming to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a>, leading for many smarks online calling him fat. He lost the weight in fall 2006, gained it back later, lost it again, gained it back...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanaBrooke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanaBrooke">Dana Brooke</a> is yet another recipient from this from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartMark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartMark">Smart Mark</a> fans as her physique has softened up since her debut. <em>Breaking Ground</em> depicts her dealing with an injury that kept her out of the ring for a while.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> developed a bit of a gut during his "Bikertaker" stint, causing fans to mock him for being out-of-shape (the fact that this is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a> of Taker's career and that his workrate declined during this period doesn't help much). He lost the extra weight around the same time that he returned to his Deadman persona.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NiaJax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NiaJax">Nia Jax</a> - who had a career as a plus sized model before WWE - has constantly had to deal with fans questioning her weight. From the second she debuted, fans were even speculating as to whether WWE had made her gain weight themselves. <em>Breaking Ground</em> shows that she's just as agile as her smaller colleagues. Jax's size became a storyline with Mickie James, ironically, being one of the people bullying her.
</li><li> Dave Meltzer came under controversy in 2018 for making comments about Peyton Royce being more attractive in her NXT days because "she was a lot lighter then". Unusually for instances like this, numerous women in the company came to her defence. Peyton herself had to say:
<div class="indent"> "What would you have me do, Dave? Starve myself? This is how nightmares for young women start."
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kazza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kazza">Kazza</a> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerlyFat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerlyFat">previously overweight</a> in her teen years, before getting into shape during her twenties. Despite this she's been constantly attacked over her weight, even when it's clear her figure does not affect her wrestling ability at all.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KateyHarvey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KateyHarvey">Katey Harvey</a> likewise was once dropped from a promotion for refusing to wrestle in less clothing - because she was concerned about her physique after several knee injuries. She was also very annoyed when a fan publicly said she wasn't "in the best shape" compared to some of the other women in Ireland. She also took the time to slam a reviewer of her return to the ring in 2019 for commenting on her appearance - when the reason she'd been out of action was a career-threatening injury that left her unable to use her arms for months! Even before she started weight lifting and developing a more muscular physique (which was preceded by years of her stressing about being thin enough), she received a "you look pregnant" chant from a crowd.

</li><li> Playwright Neil LaBute consciously averts this in his play <em>Fat Pig</em>. The title refers to the main character, a heavyset woman; the script expressly calls for her to be played by someone genuinely large, as opposed to Hollywood Pudgy.
</li><li> There have been productions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hairspray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hairspray">Hairspray</a></em> that, bizarrely, do this with main character Tracy Turnblad. Tracy is supposed to be a rare female example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFun">Big Fun</a>—she's short and heavyset, but still loves to dance and live life to the fullest. As such, the actress who plays Tracy is supposed to fit that type, and several, including the original Broadway star Marissa Jaret Winkour and the 2007 film version's star Nikki Blonsky—do so. However, some companies will instead choose to put a thin girl in a fat suit as opposed to, you know, <em>doing what the script says</em>; or at worst, <em>Not even doing the fat suit method</em> (As in cast a non-fat/chubby girl for Tracy). This is somewhat inevitable in some High School/local theater productions of the musical.

Speaking of which, eight pounds is apparently enough for that difference. On the other end of this skewed spectrum we have Macha, a rotund housekeeper. She is 5 foot 6 inches and 150 lbs. which is about the same height-to-weight ratio as Christina Hendricks, but Macha's character model has wider waist than chest.

Because she is shorter in stature and has a rounder face than the other two princesses, who are taller and have a more oval-shaped face, Daisy probably looks more thicker compared to them, but she certainly isn't fat. Some go as far as to say she has a noticeable pot-belly, although she really doesn't. If anything, she's just curvy and has slightly bigger hips.

Even the male model, while having a gut and rounded face, is more huge in general than fat; without a shirt he's so heavily muscled he looks like he could break the "muscular" model in half.

<dl><dd><ul><li> Classic Sonic is considered chubby by design, although he is only designed a round shape because he's based off of classic cartoon characters. Real hedgehogs are also round.
