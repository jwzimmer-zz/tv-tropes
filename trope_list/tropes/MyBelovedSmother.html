You might even <em>live</em> with her. A mother who tries too hard to control their children's lives. Often (but certainly not always), they are the mothers of sons, and for whatever reasons can have a bit of trouble cutting the apron strings; as a result, no matter how old the boy (or, for added humor value, man) is, he'll be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeddlingParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeddlingParents">mothered relentlessly</a>, his mother absolutely smothering him with parental affection... and authority. Using either carrot or stick (sometimes both), his mother will go to any lengths to make sure that, whether he wants to or not, he's not going to be leaving his mother's embrace any time soon. Any attempts on his part will usually result in a passive-aggressive guilt trip for trying to break away and do his own thing. Her poor son, as a result of such domination and badgering, usually ends up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommasBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommasBoy">Momma's Boy</a>. A lot of these mothers are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JewishMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JewishMother">Jewish</a> for some reason, though they are also oftentimes Catholic, serving double-duty as a conduit for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedCatholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedCatholic">Catholic guilt</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The family where the Beloved Smother lives usually feature a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a>. The Smother may be a single mother, or the father is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenpeckedHusband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenpeckedHusband">Henpecked Husband</a>; either way, he takes no independent part in raising the child, passing all control to her. The child usually has no siblings and more often than not is born late in their mother's life. Bonus points if the Beloved Smother has had trouble getting pregnant or if the child themself has or had some illness to protect from and take care of.
</p><p>The greatest threat, however, as perceived by the Smother, lies in the opposite sex. To a son, she will constantly preach that all women are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">Gold Diggers</a> who are plotting towards a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivorceAssetsConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivorceAssetsConflict">Divorce Assets Conflict</a>; to a daughter, that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts">All Men Are Perverts</a> who will leave her barefoot and pregnant, literally. Any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> that her son may attract will be immediately regarded as a rival for the son's love by the Beloved Smother, and the woman will be belittled, harassed and spied-on to varying degrees of obsession. (Hell, the Smother might actually have been through it herself.) If her son happens to break free and marry the woman he loves, then that unfortunate woman will find herself coping with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObnoxiousInLaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObnoxiousInLaws">Mother-In-Law From Hell</a>, who will be hyper-critical, dismissive and condemning of everything she does to the point where it may even break the marriage apart if her son doesn't do something to curtail his mother's interference.

</p><p>In the most favorable depiction, the Beloved Smother genuinely does love her son and wants him to be happy; she just has a little bit of trouble letting him go, and her plot arc usually revolves around the gradual realization that he's his own man and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm">she needs to cut the apron strings</a> for his own good (and, usually, hers as well), and that his moving away from her doesn't equal that he doesn't love her in return. At worst, she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Control Freak</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch">Evil Matriarch</a> who will stop at nothing  <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">not even</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse">murder</a>  to make sure that Mommy's Little Angel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTakeAndNoGive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTakeAndNoGive">remains with her at all costs</a>. For added <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squick</a> value, Mommy and Son may be a bit too close in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest">wrong kinds of ways</a>...
</p><p>It is rarer for daughters in fiction to have trouble with the Smother, but not unheard of; if the girl is unlucky enough to have a Smother, then things will be much the same (although rather than actively preventing their children from having a life outside of her, a Smother who has a daughter will usually instead start badgering her about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasCake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasCake">why they aren't married</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantGrandkids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantGrandkids">providing her with grandchildren</a> on a constant basis). With daughters, however, the dominance may sometimes have an edge of competition as well, as <em>they</em> tend to view their <em>own daughters</em> as rivals. Smothers of daughters are often ex-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitches</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGuysWantCheerleaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGuysWantCheerleaders">cheerleaders</a> who tend to bully and harass their daughters into following their footsteps as a way of living their past glories through their children.
</p><p>Like most tropes, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>; psychiatrist Carl Jung identified this archetype as the Terrible Mother, an over-nurturer who, in smothering her child, ends up stifling them to the point of hampering individuation and personal growth. In contemporary psychology, the behavior of the Smother is consistent with parent-child codependency, a trait of Borderline Personality Disorder.

She asserts her control over her son at every opportunity, trying to make every major decision for him in an attempt to guide him through the life path she wanted for herself. She refuses to allow him to have any say and even goes so far as to assert that, as the one who birthed and raised him, she owns him. At any moment in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nagisa</span> so much as <em>tries</em> to stand up for himself, Hiromi flies into a psychotic rage, shrieking at a high volume, pitch, and speed. For added torture, there is a scene of her grabbing<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nagisa</span>'s hair and <em>violently yanking his head back and forth</em> from the other side of a dinner table, no doubt unleashing hell on his scalp. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unlike other smothers, she eventually realises that she's wrong and stops doing this.</span>

However, this seems to be played with, as she might have somewhat of a reason to act the way she does, as with her questionable health, her parents splitting, and her father dying, along with being unequipped to deal with the world, she's alone otherwise, so she overprotects and coddles Ryuuko and tries to raise her in accordance to what she perceives to be best to keep some stability. Of course, like most portrayals of this trope, this doesn't have a good effect on Ryuuko, as, Ryuuko is deprived of a normal upbringing because of it.
<ul><li> As we find out, from what's implied, their mother, Ragyo, was a downplayed and more justified portrayal (along with being something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DotingParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DotingParent">Doting Parent</a>) as, because, Satsuki often sick and because she was the first baby she carried to term (according to an author's note), she would overprotect and didn't think to probably encourage her daughter out of her comfort zone. However, it's mentioned that she didn't mean to and laments that she didn't teach Satsuki "what to do".

In this continuity, Peridot acts like this to Steven to the point of taking his vitals when he's asleep and making him go to bed in the middle of the day after his first mission.

She seems genuinely sad that the ponies who ended up in Ravnica have gone native, but that doesn't stop her from considering mindwiping and kidnapping them back, or in the case of Applejack and Rainbow Dash, killing them and lying to their friends. Feather theorises that the reason Celestia is doing this is to uphold the status quo.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RoseRedemptionAU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RoseRedemptionAU">Rose Redemption AU</a></em>, Rose acts as a more benevolent version of this, referring to Steven as her "baby" and holding him every chance she gets in an effort to make up for lost time.

Inko dotes on her son Izuku but tries not to be overbearing while doing it. She quickly sees through his lies about where he's going at night, but decides to trust him and doesn't confront him about it until the night before the U.A. Entrance Exam. This is after she begins worrying about how his pseudo-celebrity status as the "Prowler Kid" would drag him into trouble.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WhiteSheepRWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WhiteSheepRWBY">White Sheep (RWBY)</a></em>: Salem, the immortal Queen of the Grimm, is extremely protective of her son Jaune. She's like this with all of her children, but it's worse with Jaune. All of his sisters can leave the tower and explore human lands, while Jaune is constantly locked away for his "protection." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">This isn't all that dissimilar to what Salem's own father did to her thousands of years ago</a>. It's no wonder Jaune ran away from home. While Jaune admits his reaction was childish, he still insists that he felt like he was backed into a corner and had no other choice because his mother wouldn't listen to him.

After Oliver shows understandable anger and panic over Laurel's first kidnapping, her immediate reaction is to have him forcibly sent to a psychiatric facility. While she does later admit that this was an overreaction born out of her protectiveness of him, the fact that this was her <em>first</em> reaction does not speak well of her.

By the end of <em>Days of Future Past</em>, Xavier finally accepts that Raven is her own person and stops trying to influence her.
</li><li> In a more general sense, Professor X doesn't encourage those who are closest to him to be fully independent as adults. Although most of his students eventually leave the school after graduation and assimilate into human society, those who are part of the X-Men never "leave the nest," so to speak. They stay together as a surrogate family while living under Xavier's roof, working as teachers, and Charles continues to exert his paternal authority over them even when they're roughly 57 years old (as shown with Jean Grey, Cyclops and Storm in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline">Alternate Timeline</a> 2023 scene of <em>Days of Future Past</em>—heck, Beast would be around 80!).

His goal is to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">placate as much as possible the "fire" within her before it consumes everything and everyone in its path. To borrow a theme from <em>First Class</em>, Charles carefully molds the emotional comfort he offers to Jean as the "serenity" which can quell to some degree the "rage" of her wild "flames." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">His manipulation of her is so well-crafted</a> that <em>he</em> dictates when the Phoenix — a <em>force of nature</em> — is free to spread its wings.

And she's terrified of it, but doesn't understand it. And he does understand it. And he can't let on to her that he understands it because it would be too frightening, and she would run away. So this scene is all about control. All about keeping that power, and keeping it all under control.

Nor was she very accommodating to Ariana's deafness, not learning sign language to facilitate an easier communication or having her even taught it (though she did hire a translator after Ariana learned this on her own).

Olivia once recounted an incident when she wanted to leave home and move in with her boyfriend — her mother <em>flipped out</em> and attacked Olivia while screaming that no one else could have her.
</li><li> In Season 12, Episode 1, the little girl sends an IM referring to her "smother" explicitly, it is later revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her mother and father had lost another little girl 10 years ago and had adopted this one to look, dress, and act just like her, going so far as to get her a nose job and dye her hair</span>.

<ul><li> Howard Wolowitz's mom seems to genuinely believe that he's still literally a child; she refers to his job as "school" and when he takes the day off, she asks if she should have someone bring him his homework. Then again, she <em>does</em> know exactly how old he is, as evidenced when she tells Howard that he's almost 30-years-old after his remarks about leaving the nest. It's more that she insists on <em>treating</em> him like a child than her actually believing he still is one.
<ul><li> In Howard's case, he allows his mother to do this (despite how much it aggravates him sometimes) because his father walked out on him and his mom when Howard was just a kid. Howard decided to always be "her little boy" so she wouldn't feel worthless.

He repeatedly signs himself and Cory up for father-son whatever classes, which normally turn out bad. He also once opened up a mobile restaurant called "Baxter and Son" because he thought it was what Cory wanted. He apparently forgot that it was HIM that put up the sign.

Come to think of it, she did this to the entire population of Liberty Avenue. Interestingly, Brian's own mother Joanie is the exact opposite of this and coupled with Brian's father being an abusive alcoholic, it's implied that the only reason Brian didn't turn out more screwed up than he did is that Debbie cared for him when he was a teenager.

Unfortunately for the laid-back, easygoing Sadie, Barb's ambitions involve over-enthusiastically supporting, pushing into, and eventually completely taking over anything Sadie is remotely interested in, in hopes of Sadie excelling and becoming some kind of superstar. Barb also seems to enjoy buying stuffed animals and making lunches for Sadie, despite Sadie apparently having already graduated high school. The fact that Sadie doesn't eat the lunches and leaves the stuffed animals in a pile on her bedroom floor does not seem to have gotten through to Barb. It takes Sadie having a panic attack and lashing out at Barb after being stampeded into doing a stage act that would have wound up publicly humiliating Sadie to make Barb (and Steven) reconsider their position.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> Myra in regards to the titular Venture Bros. Nothing says motherly love like tying up a pair of pubescent boys and shoving your breasts in their face, screaming "LET MOMMY LOVE YOU". After her first appearance, it is left somewhat ambiguous whether she is really the boys' mother. When she reappears three seasons later, her smotherhood has run rampant through the asylum where she is interned, with more or less the entire population (including some guards) dedicated to her as self-proclaimed "Momma's Boys". In the end, she seems to reveal definitively that she is <em>not</em> the Ventures' true mother, but it hardly matters at that point.
</li><li> "Colonel Bud Manstrong, listen to your mother!". He's clearly somewhere in his forties, but his mother is very much controlling his life. Bonus points for the episode she appears in being a parody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManchurianCandidate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManchurianCandidate">The Manchurian Candidate</a></em>, with the movie being mentioned by name.
</li><li> In "What Goes Down Must Come Up", the Smother is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterComputer">A.I.</a> named M.U.T.H.E.R., and the smothering is more literal than usual. Jonas Venture created her to help run his new fallout shelter, but they disagreed about "parenting issues".
<div class="indent"><strong>Dr. Entmann</strong>: Jonas thought the survivors of a nuclear holocaust might be too distraught to function as a society underground, so he wanted to pump small amounts of mood-enhancing drugs into the ventilation system. And M.U.T.H.E.R., this bitch, she didn't agree. <br/><strong>Brock</strong>: What'd she do? <br/><strong>Dr. Entmann</strong>: Well, you know when your parents catch you smoking, they make you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyMustGetStoned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyMustGetStoned">smoke the whole freaking pack</a> as punishment...
