The Glass Cannon is characterized by insane attack power coupled with pathetic defensive ability.
</p><p>Occasionally referred to as a Glass Dragon, Glass Cannons are prevalent in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">RPGs</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame">fighting games</a>, as the cast needs to be big enough that "takes hits like a chump" becomes a viable character trait. In RPGs, the Glass Cannon tends to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a>. Not all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizards</a> are completely Glass Cannon, though. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a> still can have decent or good <em>magical</em> defense but abysmal physical defense (and the aforementioned good magical defense may be undermined by low hit points), and likewise, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicallyIneptFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicallyIneptFighter">brawler</a> may have good physical defense but poor magical defense (though physically-oriented units are more likely to have a good amount of hit points). Artillery or archer units in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealTimeStrategy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealTimeStrategy">Real-Time Strategy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnBasedStrategy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnBasedStrategy">Turn-Based Strategy</a> games also tend to have this trait, as they're meant to be far away from combat, or at least in the back of the formation. If a boss happens to be a Glass Cannon, that's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RushBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RushBoss">Rush Boss</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>This can even apply in real life. Some military weapons and vehicles can deal a lot of damage, but they're easily destroyed if they take a hit. Athletes who play contact sports can also count if they run up really good statistics but are also easily injured.
</p><p>Make the Glass Cannon incapable of taking <em>any</em> punishment at all and you've got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>. A matchup between two of these usually results in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketTagGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketTagGameplay">Rocket-Tag Gameplay</a>. When the enemy tries to take out the Glass Cannon as fast as possible, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMageFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMageFirst">Shoot the Mage First</a>. They may have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullHealthBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullHealthBonus">Full Health Bonus</a> ability as another way to encourage them to avoid getting hit.
</p><p>Glass Cannons often overlap with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a>; characters of that type tend to put out high damage and dodge most incoming attacks, but go down quickly if they do get hit. Also often overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRangeFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRangeFighter">Long-Range Fighter</a>, using range to keep out of harm's way. The direct inverse of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a>, who takes it but can't dish it out. Compare and contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a>, who can dish out at the expense of speed rather than toughness, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a>, who can do the same without sacrificing anything (or sacrificing a "secondary" characteristic, such as range). A vessel mounted with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> may have some aspects of this immediately following its use, as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter">Power Limiter</a> of the weapon often is that it leaves the vessel defenseless for a time.

<ul><li> Megumin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Konosuba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Konosuba">Konosuba</a></em> was built around this concept, and then some. She can (and <em>feels a need</em> to) nuke an area once per day, but doing so drains her to the point where she is too exhausted to even <em>move</em> for a while. Likewise, that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HavingABlast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HavingABlast">Explosion</a> spell is the alpha and the omega of her spell selection.
</li><li> Accelerator from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em> is a strange example of this. Normally he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh Invulnerable</a> thanks to his ability to redirect all vectors within a certain radius of him (if he has an oxygen tank, a <em>nuke</em> wouldn't faze him). He's also incredibly powerful to the point of being able to <em>casually break a continent</em> if sufficiently pissed. However, once that fancy ability of his is bypassed, he's nothing more than a scrawny teenager waiting to be pummeled.
</li><li> Shin Kazama of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88">Area 88</a></em> fits the type. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He deals a nasty blow to Saki's head during a temporary psychotic rage, but Mickey floors him with one punch.</span>
</li><li> Shiki, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> and (sort-of) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat">Black Cat</a></em>. His <em>normal</em> attacks do more damage than anything this side of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s <em>final</em> moves, but he goes down with one <em>pistol-whip</em> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Train</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ikkaku's sword is unpredictable, dangerous, and incredibly powerful. However, it breaks easily because its shikai form is a wooden spear, and the bankai's overpowered force makes itself brittle. Ikkaku is refusing to use his power correctly and has been chastised for that by Iba. It's heavily implied that his misuse of his power is why the weapon keeps breaking so easily; the Zanpakutou inventor, Nimaiya, openly tells Renji and Ichigo that Zanpakutou which are not correctly used will break easily. Ikkaku himself is not this trope, having immense stamina and the ability to shrug off wounds with sheer willpower.
</li><li> Chojiro Sasakibe is said to rival the Captains in strength (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and has a bankai that Captain-Commander Yamamoto himself recognizes as immensely powerful</span>), but his first on-screen fight (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">such as it is</a>) has him as one of the three Vice-Captains that an <em>bare-handed</em> Ichigo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO">knocks out with a single punch</a>. Apparently, for all his strength he has a glass jaw.
</li><li> Ran Tao in the anime filler Bount Arc is a very skilled spell user but her stamina is heavily compromised <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">her extreme age</a></span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa">Captain Tsubasa</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Japanese National Team. They've got excellent scorers in Tsubasa, Aoi, and Hyuga as well as great GK's like Wakabayashi and Wakashimazu, but one of their biggest flaws is how easily their defense can be torn and the rival teams can try their luck at scoring. And since the two Waka GK's are prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury">Game Breaking Injuries</a>...
</li><li> Single player version: Jun Misugi.

Hence why he's seen more often than not in manager positions and doesn't play until it's mandatory.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>: Light Yagami and all other Death Note users definitely qualify. They can kill anyone whose face and name they know, but are no more bullet resistant than anyone else.
</li><li> Wisely of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em> can be considered this compared to other Noah (they are all physically superhumans anyway). His power allows him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> anyone by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadASplode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadASplode">crushing their brain with a mere glance</a>. However, when he indirectly received an attack on his head he was stunned for the rest of the arc. Besides, he declares himself as "not a fighter".
</li><li> Marcille of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon">Delicious in Dungeon</a></em> is a powerful mage who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">becomes capable of standing toe-to-toe with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Lunatic Magician</a>, the creator of the dungeon, for a brief period of time before overexerting herself. Keep in mind, she was the only person in the party capable of even slowing the Magician down</span>. She's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">pretty weak physically and not able to take many hits.</a>
</li><li> May of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> has quite a few different ranged attacks with her alkahestry, but is one of the least durable characters, partly the result of being a young girl.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo">Hajime no Ippo</a></em>, minor character Eleki Battery who fought Kimura is definitely one. He has enough power to knock Kimura down in one blow, however, all Kimura needed to do was land one hit to his body to knock him down.
<ul><li> Also Ryuichi Hayami, who's got very good counters and speed as well as strength... but one well placed punch and he's out. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This gets so bad that, when Kobashi manages to deal him a REALLY well-placed hit in the jaw, the injury he sustains forces him to retire.</span>

<ul><li> Diavolo's Stand in part 5, King Crimson, is one of (if not THE) most powerful Stands in terms of raw striking power, with an A rank in Power and Speed. However, it has an E rank in terms of durability. This is why Diavolo tries to end his fights with a single strike, as he can't survive an extended assault.
</li><li> By part 6, Jotaro's Stand, Star Platinum, has degraded from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> to this. It maintains its legendary speed and strength, and it has a much bigger range than in part 3; but Jotaro's age combined with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the strain inflicted on him when he uses its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill">time stopping power</a></span> resulted in its durability dropping from rank A to E.
</li><li> Stand users in general, with a few exceptions like DIO, aren't any tougher than those without powers; so any with a particularly potent offense is going to fall into this if they start taking direct hits. Most noticeable with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamPet">Iggy in Part 3</a>, who has a very powerful stand with a wide range of abilities, but is still a small dog with all the fragility that one would expect. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This leads to him being mortally injured from a few strong kicks.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>:
<ul><li> Fate's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Sonic Drive</a> form introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikerS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikerS">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Striker S</a></em>. It improves on her original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Sonic Form</a> by giving her a lot of oomph to complement the speed increase, boosting her magic powers to astounding levels and letting her access <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmyWeapon">Bardiche's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BifurcatedWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BifurcatedWeapon">Riot Zamber</a> form. But much like the original Sonic Form, all of this comes at the cost of armor, so all it'll take is one good hit to make her fall. Not that it proves to be much of a detriment; so far, only Erio has managed to land a hit during a mock battle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaVivid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaVivid">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha ViVid</a></em>, where it indeed wiped out most of Fate's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a>.
</li><li> Hayate has also shades of this: her spells range from nuclear explosion to... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">bigger nuclear explosion</a>, but it comes with looooooong casting time and inability to take hits. She even said Caro would win against her in one-on-one. This is counterbalanced by the fact that Hayate almost never fights one on one; even without her other allies, most of the time she still has Reinforce with her, who can separate and hold off a target with a slew of not quite as powerful, but quite a bit faster spells while Hayate prepares her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>.
</li><li> Lutecia Alpine is an S-rank summoner who, in <em>StrikerS</em>, is capable of summoning insects that rival Caro's powers, but has hardly any moves with which to protect herself. However, as of <em>ViVid</em>, she appears to have developed the magical capabilities to fight alone well enough to enter the tournament alongside Vivio and her friends.
</li><li> The Numbers from <em>StrikerS</em> are very powerful, but they can't take hits that well and most of them seem to not have defense skills. Their teamwork makes them dangerous, but if you're strong or skilled enough to take one after another down, then it's not a problem. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, all Numbers are defeated by one or a few hits.
</li><li> Like Fate, Micaiah Chevelle from <em>ViVid</em> is this overlapped with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a>: she has a Barrier Jacket (or Knight Clothing) which is designed to give her immense speed for minimum defense. This speed supports her extremely powerful sword attacks greatly, but her lack of defense becomes a lethal disadvantage against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> Miura who has melee versions of Nanoha's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">Starlight Breaker</a>.

However, it's also slow and offers no defensive advantages whatsoever, meaning that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after disabling Fate with it temporarily</span> she ends up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">cut in half by Quartum</span> with absolutely no way to defend herself or any real ability to negate the damage. The only thing going for her defensively is that she has less vital points than an actual human.
</li><li> Alyssa of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiHime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiHime">Mai Hime</a></em> has the ability to cause devastation on a large scale with her Child, Artemis, but unlike other Himes, does not have an Element to protect herself, instead relying on Miyu's assistance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>:

It is equipped with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">Big Friggin'</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave Motion Guns</a> that can also function as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone">Attack Drones</a>. However, due to said Gundam not being equipped with real GN Drives as well as the lack of resources used while it was being created, all defensive capabilities were sacrificed in favor of its offense. His earlier Gundam Nadleeh qualifies as well: it's essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> with the Exia's close-combat attack power. Naturally, it's only used in emergency as it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualModeUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualModeUnit">Dual Mode Unit</a>, its other form being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Gundam Virtue</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaExpansionPack">GN Arms</a> from the first season too. Lockon absolutely owned everyone with it until Ali incapacitated him with a single well-aimed shot at his beam cannon. Then it turned out the Gundam piloting the exoskeleton is tougher than the actual exoskeleton! Another example of this trope is the Gadessa: its main weapon is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> with ridiculous range... and not much armor. It still has a backup weapon and a beam saber but its defensive capabilities are nowhere near those of the others, as Lockon took it out in the final battle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">with a point-blank burst from his Gundam's sidearm after</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingPossum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingPossum">Playing Possum</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickThemWhileTheyAreDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickThemWhileTheyAreDown">to lure it close</a>.

Zaku's are portrayed as having tremendous and devastating firepower...but one direct hit from a tiny tank or missile team can still one shot them. Fortunately, it seems that even non new type mook Zeke's can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DodgeTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DodgeTheBullet">Dodge the Bullet</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>:
<ul><li> The protagonist, Izuku Midoriya, is this taken to its logical extreme. Due to obtaining his Quirk, One For All, later in life, he has no idea how to moderate its insane power at first. Because of this, he has to shatter the bones in whatever limb he uses it in. As a trade-off, the immense power it produces can demolish entire buildings, topple giant robots, and create massive gusts of wind. He leans away from this as his control improves, allowing him to restrict the damage to just one of his fingers and later spreading the power throughout his body evenly to give himself a much smaller boost to his strength and speed without hurting himself. But he still has to carefully moderate how he's using One For All, lest his concentration breaks and he accidentally uses its full power and hurts himself again.
</li><li> Seiji Shishikura is a pretty extreme glass cannon. His power, "Meatball," allows him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">reshape the flesh of anyone</a> he comes in physical contact with, which pretty much instantly immobilizes them. He can even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DetachmentCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DetachmentCombat">detach chunks of himself and shoot them at others</a>, which will adhere to them. In his introduction, he effortlessly inflicts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">one-hit KOs</a> to at least a dozen heroes. However, if he so much as takes damage, anyone he's shaped into meatballs will revert back to normal. That is, for him to be effective, he cannot be hit by any attack, no matter how small.
</li><li> Kaminari's power is the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">discharge an enormous amount of electricity</a> into the surrounding area. The problem is, once he does this, the power basically fries his brain and turns him into an idiot, meaning that he gets one shot before becoming totally useless for the next hour or so. And he's not any physically stronger than a normal human, making him something of a sitting duck. Later on, he starts to train specifically to avoid this issue.
</li></ul></li><li> Itachi Uchiha is basically this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>. Despite having three of the most powerful attacks in the entire manga, Itachi's base arsenal lacks versatility. Not only that, a sufficiently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">strong character</a> could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO">One-Hit KO</a> if they got close (though since Itachi is one of the fastest charcters in the series, this is extremely difficult). His stamina is particularly low as well, meaning he can't fight for extended periods. Those three powerful attacks? They cost more than <em>30%</em> of his total chakra, meaning he can't spam them like his brother Sasuke can. This is likely a result of the fact that he is dying from a serious illness during the events of the series, and was likely more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> when he was healthy (indeed he is referenced as single-handedly defeating armies years before the events of the series). Subverted by the fact that one of his techniques gives him a giant exoskeleton that turns him into one of the most durable characters in the series but he can only maintain it briefly. Completely subverted to the point he arguably becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a> after his reincarnation. Not only is he immortal and virtually indestructible, but he also has endless chakra reserves meaning that he can maintain that giant exoskeleton indefinitely and spam all the extremely powerful techniques he could previously use only sparingly. His physical strength too appears to increase dramatically or at least be restored to the level it had been when he was healthy, with him easily overwhelming a Naruto who had access to almost all of the Ninetails' chakra with kicks alone.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:

Her durability, however, is very puny and no better than that of real life human.
</li><li> King Elizabello II of the Prodence Kingdom's signature attack, the King Punch, can make a hole in an enemy fortress wall, though it takes an hour to charge so he needs to be protected while preparing it. When tried out in an arena, it basically <em>destroyed</em> it, and would have killed the audience if a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior">Barrier Warrior</a> hadn't been standing by.

Of course, this is just compared to the completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a> fighters in most of the series (he was called a wuss for being <em>moderately injured</em> by a boulder... being thrown by tornado winds that were drilling into the ground and altering the course of an underground river).
</li></ul></li></ul><dl><dd><ul><li> Akane Tendo as well. Though she can dish out punches with the best of them, she has nowhere near the healing speed or toughness of any of the other characters; while she is too skilled to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">The Load</a> in an actual fight, she is still regarded by some as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselScrappy">Damsel Scrappy</a> because she insists on getting into a fight, but somebody (mainly Ranma) usually has to keep an eye on her because she can't take the hits they can.

He is extremely powerful, able to curb-stomp a bloodshot Kirihara using even greater violent play than him. However, he lacks stamina and defense. Considering this it comes as no surprise that Devil Akaya completely trashes him in a matter of minutes.

His English voice actor Matt Shipman has commented on this shortcoming a few times.

In particular, <em>Armageddon</em> and <em>Shin VS Neo</em> have plenty of lavishly-detailed battle damage marks and scars forming as the Getters get crushed and even get their arms ripped off. While they can exhibit very impressive and outright terrifying offensive potential, the Getters tend to get beat-up far more than many traditional Super Robots.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NausicaaOfTheValleyOfTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NausicaaOfTheValleyOfTheWind">NausicaÃ¤ of the Valley of the Wind</a></em>:

Yet his physical strength and durability are regularly portrayed as sub-par, often being injured by much weaker opponents. This is somewhat subverted by the fact that he can block attacks with his sword. This is exaggerated even further when he uses his 'abstract cutting' and fights without his sword, increasing his offensive power, but no longer even being able block attacks.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMan">X-Man</a>, Nate Grey, is an example early on in his career. He's more powerful than Apocalypse (beating the AOA version nearly to death in one of his first serious fights), is ranked on a par with the Dark Phoenix for pure power, and equated with Franklin Richards, later squaring off with the likes of Thanos. However, he's still just human, physically speaking (which is unfortunate, since he tends to lead with his fists and/or his chin), and his genetic degeneration means he has very little stamina. This leads the likes of Dark Beast, X-Cutioner, and other relatively low-level opponents who can get past the first shot posing a real threat to him. Unlike most, though, he trains up â€” more stamina is just the start.

In particular is Mauler 5150, which is infamous for getting tipped upside-down by pretty much anything that its spinning doesn't wreck first, such as with <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS9i8JgLjTU">a light tap from Jabberwock<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> Any robot with a flywheel too. They're very devastating weapons, but also very heavy too, usually taking up 20%-25% of the robot's weight allotment. Designers, forced to shed weight to ensure it's light enough to compete, often go for shedding armour first. Flywheels also tended to have enormous recoil when they struck something, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">causing damage to internal components</a>. One of the best examples would be <em>Robot Wars</em>' Hypno-disc, which became <em>the</em> reason bots had to invest on heavier armor after utterly tearing apart another bot in its very first match, and would generally mangle its opponents spectacularly. But it had the problem the rest of its chassis was rather frail and easy to shove around, and a bot with enough armor could simply outlast it by tanking its strikes until it tore itself apart. Most of its losses were from having taken so much damage even after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> it had to battle with incomplete repairs.

The details have changed over the years, but at its essence Nightmare's basically a <em>monstrous</em> vertical flywheel mounted on a spindly, easy-to-tip three-wheeled frame with exposed tires (although it did get wheel guards for the 2015 reboot). Whenever Nightmare fights, <em>someone</em> is leaving the Battlebox in pieces â€” <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle">usually depending on who gets the first hit</a>.
</li><li> Deep Six's 2019 version consists of an <em>enormous</em> vertical spinning bar that alone takes up over half of the robot's weight. The rest of the robot exists mainly to allow that bar to spin and move about. As a result, of its three matches fought that year, two of them ended in it eliminating itself from the fight by recoilâ€”on its first hit.

<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball">American Football</a>, quarterbacks can do punishing damage throwing the ball downfield and serve as the offense's field general. However, if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a> offensive linemen screw up their blocking assignments, the quarterback usually doesn't have the strength or mobility to do anything except brace for impact and try not to get hurt by the 300+ pound men piling onto him. However, mobile quarterbacks like Dak Prescott or Deshaun Watson have the speed to evade defenders.
</li><li> Bob Sanders, safety in the NFL, long of the Indianapolis Colts. One of the league's hardest hitters, maybe the best safety in all of football... when he was healthy, which for a while was about as rare as the Colts beating the Chargers in those days (the latter is no longer rare for the Colts). Sanders frequently spent half the regular season on the injured list, which might be because he played so hard all the time, running full-force into offensive players on every play. The Colts finally released him after the 2010 season, and Sanders played one more (injury-shortened) season for the Chargers before being dropped for good.
</li><li> The Eagles' Michael Vick fits the archetype perfectly. With his freakish speed and arm strength, Vick is the single most dangerous playmaker in the league... as long as he doesn't get hit too hard. In 9 seasons, he's played all 16 games only once, and has spent quite a few contests limited due to one injury or another. Not counting the 2 seasons he missed while answering to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prison">Federal Inmate #33765-183</a>".
</li><li> Dan Marino of the Miami Dolphins is frequently ranked as one of the NFL's greatest quarterbacks of all time, setting or breaking numerous records. Sadly, during his professional career, the Dolphins had one of the worst defenses in the league. He got to play in only one Super Bowl, Super Bowl XIX in the 1984-85 season, where the Dolphins were throttled 38-16 by the San Francisco 49ers. It probably didn't help that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirteenIsUnlucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirteenIsUnlucky">he wore the #13 jersey</a>.
</li><li> Hockey player Eric Lindros was called the "Next One" by pro scouts in the late 1980s, in reference to Wayne Gretzky's nickname of the "Great One" as the single best player to ever put on skates. Lindros seemed to have it all, from massive size to impressive speed to a gifted scoring touch. When he made it to the National Hockey League, he was one of the most dominant players in the league...and one of the most injured, which led him to top both the scoring charts and the injury reports.
</li><li> The "Seven Seconds or Less" Phoenix Suns of the mid-2000s had arguably the most potent offense in NBA history, but their porous defense caused them to never reach the NBA Finals.
</li><li> Mixed martial artists:
<ul><li> Alistair Overeem is known for two things: his freakish knockout power and his glass chin.
</li><li> Brock Lesnar was known for his incredible speed and strength, which he used to ragdoll heavyweights and pummel them into paste... unless he got hit on the chin, in which case he'd instantly turtle up.
</li><li> Andrei Arlovski had excellent hand speed and punching power, but was notoriously easy to knock out.

<ul><li> There is an old (board and miniatures) gaming expression called the <em>fuzzy wuzzy fallacy</em> (after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyardKipling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyardKipling">Rudyard Kipling</a> poem). Basically it states that a unit's effectiveness goes up proportionate to the square root of any increase in firepower (provided the defense stays the same). For example, the above Mech has roughly 3.5 times the firepower of the old version. FW numbers say that it's about 1.87 (the root of 3.5) times as effective as the old one, given that both die just as easy (and will draw fire like no-one's business).

</li></ul></li><li> In the Flying Frog game <em>Touch of Evil,</em> the schoolteacher only has three hit points and no healing factor. However, loading her inventory up with books adds two additional fight dice per book. Collecting all the books on the board gives her three hit points...and up to <em>twenty-two</em> dice's worth of damage. By the game's mechanics, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">that's theoretically enough to one-shot Cthulhu.</a>
</li><li> The Eldar and Dark Eldar of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> often overlap this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a>.
<ul><li> The Dark Eldar are more of Glass Cannons than the Eldar, given the amount of firepower that squads of Dark Eldar can pump out for a relatively low cost and the eschewing of even what little armor their cousins use.
<ul><li> Harlequins are even more of a glass hammer/cannon than other Eldar. Absolutely unparalleled in hand-to-hand combat, they can rip right through a unit of Assault Terminators like tissue paper; but one good round of shooting from a basic Marine squad and they're splattered all over the landscape.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Space Marine</a> Thunderfire cannon. In fact, <em>all</em> artillery pieces were like this prior to 6th edition. As an artillery piece, anything shooting at it has a 50/50 chance of hitting either it or the Techmarine manning it. Hitting the Tech is not a huge issue, with a 2+ armor save, but if the cannon itself is hit, either a penetrating hit or glancing hit will completely destroy it (until 6th edition, when artillery guns were given a very strong Toughness value of 7 and two "wound points"). But it has a range of 60', and puts out four explosive shells per turn.
</li><li> And Tau Fire Warriors, who are no tougher than Guard Stormtroopers and suck in close combat. However, they're armed with a gun that will punch through Stormtrooper armor, the Stormtrooper wearing the armor, and keep going out the back.
<ul><li> Speaking of Stormtroopers, their hellguns can punch right through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Space Marine</a> armor. Too bad for the shorter than normal range.
</li></ul></li><li> The Tau's Vespid allies overlap this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a>. They have a gun that can blast clean through Space Marine armor from 18" away, and can move reasonably quickly, but even with T4 and a 4+ armor save, they still go down like chumps to even a brief encounter with heavy bolter fire.
</li><li> Ork Boyz: they have a massive amount of attacks for a rank-and-file trooper (three attacks per Boy, four on the charge), and... paper thin armor. Kinda balanced out by their ridiculously low point cost, but when they get showered by bolter fire, expect a lot of Boyz to drop.
</li><li> Daemons also deserve a mention â€” most of them pack a punch, but die like flies against standard Imperial weaponry because their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">"armor"</a> is intentionally designed to be fickle. They have a 33% chance of surviving <em>anti-starship weapons</em>, but a 67% chance of dying to a single small-arms round to the face.
</li><li> The Imperial Guard Hellhound. Most Imperial Guard vehicles are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a>, but the Hellhound, for all the flamethrowers it mounts, can go up with a mild hit due to the tanks being hit.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RogueTrader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RogueTrader">Rogue Trader</a></em> rulebook specifically describes Raider-class spacecraft as "glass cannons, able to throw out heavy fire but unable to take it in return".
</li><li> Eldar and Dark Eldar spacecraft in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattlefleetGothic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattlefleetGothic">Battlefleet Gothic</a></em> have wimpy armor, no shields, ridiculously powerful engines, and some of the nastiest guns possible.
</li><li> Most walkers, due to them having medium to light armor all around, as opposed to the incredibly tough front armor and weaker side and back armors of conventional tanks. The Penitent Engine and Ork Killa Kans in particular have it bad, as their armor is no better than the lightest transports in the game (the Penitent Engine is an open topped vehicle too). The only aversion so far is the Soul Grinder, which has near land-raider levels of armor while packing very effective guns and devastating melee capability (its only real weakness is everything else in the army tends to suck).
</li><li> Imperial and Renegade Knights are devastating weapon platforms capable of wielding rapid-fire battle cannons and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">massive gatling guns</a> simultaneously. However, they only have an armour value of about 13 and their ion shield can only protect one facing at a time. On top of this, the absolute cheapest Knight is about 325pts and only has six hull points, about twice that of the much tinier Space Marine Dreadnought; the kitted-out ones can close in on 500 points, still with only six hull.
</li><li> The Chaos Forgefiend with three ectoplasma cannons is capable of tearing through heavily armoured elite forces in seconds â€” its blasts can disintegrate entire squads of Grey Knight Terminators. However, those same cannons are prone to overheating and damaging its hull, which is comparatively fragile at 3 Hull Points for a 200 point unit.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Battletech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Battletech">Battletech</a></em> universe:
<ul><li> The <em>Hunchback IIc</em> BattleMech exemplifies this trope. It mounts two Ultra Autocannon-20s which, more or less, is apocalyptic firepower for any 'Mech (<em>each</em> Ultra AC can do 40 damage, which will destroy any mech its weight or less with a center hit), but sacrifices almost all of its armor in order to do so. Little wonder it's popular with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seeker</a> Mechwarriors. In fact, a recent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sourcebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sourcebook">sourcebook</a> clarifies: It was made as pretty much the Clan's equivalent of a Death sentence. Any warrior assigned to a <em>Hunchback IIc</em> is explicitly <em>not</em> expected to come back from their next battle.
</li><li> In the same vein, the dinky <em>UrbanMech</em> mounts an AC/10, but has only 6 tons of armorâ€”appreciable for its size of 30 tons, but still not very much. However, any light mech <em>will</em> be cored if Urbie hits it, and more than one Urbie makes things get very dangerous in a hurry unless you outrange them. Plus they're such <em>cute</em> little things!
</li><li> See also the <em>Hollander</em> family. The original was a 35-tonner packing a mighty Gauss Rifle... and only that. With only four tons of armor for protection, it can barely take a hit from its own weapon. Other variants tried to mitigate this with limited success, but a few actually doubled down on it. One variant of the 45-ton <em>Hollander II</em> carried a <em>Heavy</em> Gauss Rifle, but had so little armor it stood a chance of <em>killing itself</em> every time it fired<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ycnn');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ycnn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ycnn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Firing a Heavy Gauss Rifle required a piloting roll to keep from falling down if the mech has used movement points that round. As a medium mech, the Hollander II has a penalty for that roll. Worse, the mech's rear armor was insufficient to take the impact of its own weight, so falling was an automatic chance of a critical hit. If it fell on the left torso(best-case scenario), it lost a ton of ammunition. If it fell on the center torso, it damaged its engine or gyro, and if it fell on the right torso, the Gauss Rifle takes the hit and explodes with just enough force to destroy both the Right and Center torsos, thus wrecking the mech.</span>.
</li><li> A lot of "support" 'mechs, like the classic <em>Archer</em> or the frankly ridonkulous-looking <em>Yeoman</em>, will mount a lot of long range weapons like LRMs, but have little armor or weapons for close-and-dirty combat.
</li><li> There are a few vehicles like this, such as the <em>Hetzer</em> Wheeled Assault Gun, effectively a rehash of a <em>World War II</em> design, and the tiny 5-ton <em>Savannah Master</em> â€” the fact that it was deliberately designed to take on enemy Battlemechs has to count for <em>something.</em> Neither design has much armor, but both have a lot of firepower for their size. The <em>Savannah Master</em> has the firepower and speed to equal to a 'Mech four times its size, but can be destroyed by a single laser hit from its own gun. Meanwhile, the <em>Hetzer</em> is larger and slower, but mounts a huge, dangerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">200 millimeter autocannon</a> in its hull that has a chance to bring down even the mightiest of 'Mechs with a single hitâ€”without giving it more than a token amount of armor to cover its fragile, boxy hull.
</li><li> In the novels particularly, the old Inner Sphere <em>Rifleman</em> 'mech is notorious as a deathtrap, with rear armor somewhere between cardboard and tin can levels. You don't want to be standing in front of it, though â€” <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">each arm mounts</a> an autocannon and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams">medium and large lasers</a>.
</li><li> The <em>Hellbringer</em> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReportingName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReportingName">Loki</a></em>) Omni is another fine example of a machine that will slaughter most enemies in its weight class and down if they get too close, but will crumple and burn if anything with a decent gun looks at it funny. Its configurations focus on massed long range hitting power, with things like particle cannons, Gauss rifles, and autocannons coming into play. The primary variant is a highly accurate killing machine with enough firepower on it to literally slag four tons of armor in a single salvo and even includes various equipment upgrades like ECM or anti missile defenses. At 65 tons and with only 8 tons of armor, though, while it is slightly better protected than the aforementioned <em>Hunchback IIc</em>, it'll have an extremely bad day if a sufficiently armed 'Mech draws a bead on it. It's so light on armor that it actually can't even absorb an AC/20 shot dead centerâ€”something that more than a few 15-tons-lighter 'Mechs <em>can</em> do.
</li><li> The <em>Adder/Puma</em> is another high grade glass cannon. Its primary configuration carries dual ER-PPC weapons and includes a targeting computer to make them highly accurate. Any 'Mech who takes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">Boom, Headshot!</a> from one of those guns is down for the count, no matter the size of it. The Adder, however, is all of 35 tons, has about 6 tons of armor, and generally isn't going to stick around very long once an enemy sniffs it out.
</li><li> The <em>Cougar</em> is, if anything, even more extreme than the <em>Adder</em>. While weighing the same 35 tons, its armor is pared down to just five and a half tons, and its speed is further cut to levels more often seen on Clan 'Mechs twice its size, making it less capable of dodging attacks. In exchange, it now boasts a full ninteen tons of firepower, meaning that over 50% of this thing is guns. Its basic configuration carries two highly accurate long-ranged lasers and a pair of long range missile racks. One of its alternate models matches the <em>Adder</em> exactly for deadliness with its dual PPC loadout, while another is a perfect copy of the <em>Archer,</em> a highly respected Inner Sphere 'Mech that is twice the size of a <em>Cougar</em>.
</li><li> The <em>Hollander</em> is a classic example, being sluggish, lightly armored, and inherently fragileâ€”it weighs 35 tons, carries a mere 4 tons of armor, and one side of its torso is packed full of volatile, explosive capacitors. It's so fragile that a large laser hit to any body part is enough to seriously threaten its continued existence. However, those same capacitors power a 15-ton <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons">Gauss rifle</a>, which packs enough kinetic energy to bore a hole straight through smaller 'Mechs or smash a ton of armor off bigger ones, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipingTheCockpit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipingTheCockpit">Sniping the Cockpit</a> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> on any 'Mech.
</li><li> The <em>Excalibur</em> is a mighty-looking machine and boasts both a Gauss rifle and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">long range missile pack</a> in its primary configuration. It even moves at a healthy 86 kph, impressive for a 70-ton 'Mech. It buys that mobility and long-range prowess with a woefully thin seven and a half tons of armor, enough to weather one or two light missile barrages, but not enough to survive repeated fire from bigger guns like a PPC or a 100mm autocannon.
</li><li> There's a variant of the <em>Shadow Hawk</em> that adds a second short range missile launcher, a second medium laser, and two more heat sinks to its chassis. This changes the <em>Shadow Hawk</em> from a mediocre <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">Master of None</a> into a respectable barrage vehicle at short rangeâ€”it can leap into battle and unload all its weapons without too much stress on the heat gauge. The problem is that it buys this firepower in armor, reducing it to an anemic 4.5 tons of armor, less that some 'Mechs half its size... and it still carries four tons of highly volatile missile and autocannon ammunition in its chest, so one unlucky hit could lead to a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">Stuff Blowing Up</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> 4E</em> gives us the Striker set of classes (Ranger, Rogue, Warlock, Barbarian, though the Barbarian has pretty good HP, if lackluster starting armor): Insane damage output, but rely on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Defenders</a> to hold down the thing they're attacking so that they don't get crushed.
<ul><li> 3.5 psionics has the wilder class. Less than a fourth of the powers of a Psion, but can up each powers output by your level, turning a single level 3 character into something capable of cutting down much higher level enemies on average rolls. Has little health and can daze/weaken themselves afterward. Unfortunately, the downsides add up to make it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing">Some 3.5 characters, using a number of different sourcebooks,</a> can become this trope. As an example, take an ordinary fighter and give him Power Attack, a feat which subtracts attack accuracy in exchange for higher damage. Then take a feat called Shock Trooper, which shifts the accuracy penalty to armor class â€” i.e. it makes you easier to hit. This build, known as the 'Charger build' and often <em>by</em> the name Glass Cannon, results in a character able to do massive damage when he charges in and attacks ... but at the cost of an armor class that a small child throwing rocks could probably hit.
</li><li> 3.5 Rangers gain a number of combat style feats to enable either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding">Dual Wielding</a> or archery, a damage boost from Favored Enemy, and spells like Hunter's Mercy and Blade Storm to up their damage further. It's also quite common to dip into Scout and take Swift Hunter, meaning they receive the benefits of Skirmish's damage boost. However, Rangers are restricted to wearing light armor, their need to boost multiple stats tends to give them middling Constitution, and their HD is a merely average d8 rather than the d10 of Fighters or the d12 of Barbarians. Though not incapable of taking a hit, Rangers <em>really</em> don't like being the only tank character in the group.
</li><li> Duskblades utilize a nasty form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullContactMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullContactMagic">Full-Contact Magic</a> that can reduce most level-appropriate foes to dust, but possess virtually no defensive spells, middling HD, and similar armor restrictions to the Ranger.
</li><li> Rogues became this with the buffing of Backstab into Sneak Attack, enabling them to output some rather crazy damage against vulnerable or flanked enemies. With proper feat setup and equipment, a Rogue could take down most level-appropriate foes in one round. However, they have the second-worst saves in the game (only Reflex), are limited to light armor, and have poor HD. If they don't assassinate their target in the first round, they tend to struggle. In general, this ethos is common among skill-based characters, with the Ninja, Factotum, Spellthief, and Scout all having similar strengths and weaknesses.
</li><li> 5e has fewer intricacies than other editions, but most Arcane casters (aka magic users who do not derive their power from faith or deities) still fit this trope. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards">Linear Warriors, Quadratic Wizards</a> is in full effect, and spell casters can do some serious damage even at first level, with spells like Magic Missile, which deals little damage but never misses, or Firebolt, which has a higher potential damage output than fighters with short swords at the same level. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note27ixe');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note27ixe" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note27ixe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Firebolt deals a single D10 damage. Shortswords deal 1d6 plus the wielder's strength or dexterity, which is likely not more than +3 at that point</span>. However, most casters are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a>, and a single hit can be enough to take them out.
</li></ul></li><li> There are plenty of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> cards that have high power but low toughness. However, the card <a class="urllink" href="http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?&amp;id=83719">Glass Golem<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> seems to deliberately invoke this trope.
<ul><li> Not to mention cards like <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1133">Rocket Launcher<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and its later cleaned-up cousin <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=48215">Goblin Cannon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which take the "cannon" part more literally.
</li><li> Also, a number of Illusion creatures are designed to hit hard, but die as soon as targeted by anything.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=130713">Force of Savagery<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is another extreme example. It has massive power but <em>zero</em> toughness so it automatically dies when it enters the battlefield unless its toughness is being passively boosted.
</li><li> Perhaps the most extreme example lies with <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=368981">Master of Cruelties<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It has a moderate Toughness of 4, and a mediocre Power of 1, and can only attack alone without backup. However, it also packs First Strike and Death Touch, thus becoming instant death to any creature that blocks it. Even worse, if its attack connects without being blocked, the unfortunate player's life total <em>instantly drops to 1</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Between the five colors, red is the one that most exhibits this trope. Most mono-red creatures tend to have very low toughness, but higher power. Since red is more about dealing as much damage to its opponent as quickly as possible, its creatures don't need to survive, just take a few cheap shots in.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech">Carefree Hedonist</a> characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BlissStage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BlissStage">Bliss Stage</a></em> start out with 7 instead of 6 relationships, most of which have very high Intimacy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">and form very powerful psychic weapons</a>. Only TWO of those relationships have enough Trust for the weapons they manifest as to survive a critical failure.
</li><li> There are various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> cards like: Goblin Attack Force, Indomitable Fighter Lei Lei, Spear Dragon, and Mad Archfiend that have incredibly high ATK, but zero DEF and move into defense position when it is time for your opponent to strike.
<ul><li> Clear Vice Dragon has double the ATK of the monster it's attacking. When it's not attacking, it has 0 ATK.
</li><li> Similarly, Metalmorph gives the equipped card a massive attack boost, but only while attacking.
</li><li> Dragon Master Knight has a titanic ATK stat and an effect that makes it stronger, but it has no defenses whatsoever from card effects.
<ul><li> This was the standard design philosophy for an ace card roughly until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stardust Dragon</a> showed up: a card with 2800 ATK or more, with an effect that lets it kill even more monsters and do even more damage than its ATK score would suggest, and no protection or negation abilities whatsoever. The most infamous examples should probably be the Chaos monsters, which can easily knock off half your opponent's LP in a single turn on their own, but fold like a wet paper bag to a garden-variety Bottomless Trap Hole or Sakuretsu Armor.
</li></ul></li><li> Berserk Dragon has 3500 ATK and 0 DEF, which would already qualify it for this trope. However, it goes the extra mile, with an insanely strong offensive effect (can attack all cards your opponent controls) and a tendency to fold quickly if it doesn't knock out the opponent in one shot, due to growing weaker every turn it's on the field.
</li><li> When Armityle the Chaos Phantasm is attacking, it has 10,000 ATK; the highest fixed number in the entire game, and twice as high as the highest-ATK monster in the game. When it's not attacking, it has <em>zero</em> â€” and on top of that, it can't be destroyed by battle, meaning the opponent can keep attacking it over and over as if they were hitting you directly.
</li><li> Many monsters have effects that increase their ATK but not their DEF â€” Tyranno Infinity, for instance, gains 1000 ATK for every banished Dinosaur, meaning it can go up to flatly ridiculous values, but its DEF is always 0. For the most part, this doesn't actually impact survivability as much as you'd think, as monsters only use DEF while in Defense Mode.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasyRoleplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasyRoleplay">Warhammer Fantasy</a></em> has a few. Night Goblin Fanatics follow it the best â€” they deal the same damage as a giant catapult but are even easier to kill than a normal goblin and have a chance of killing themselves. There are, however, many others.

They have little to no armor but can give out a lot of hurt with possibly the best core units compared to their prices.
</li><li> High Elves have very few units with toughness higher than 3, but they make up for it with <em>Speed of Asuryan</em>, gaining attack bonuses if their Initiative score is higher... and at 5 initiative on most of them, it usually is. This rule also ignores striking order penalties for weapons, so they can wield <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">whopping weapons</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal">willy-nilly</a> at no penalty.

<ul><li> Fast Patrol Ships (formerly known as Pseudo-Fighters). They can carry devastating armament, but their shields are paper-thin. The rules even refer to them as "eggshells armed with sledgehammers." PFs with Warp Booster Packs gain extra warp-engine power, which they can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimTaylorTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimTaylorTechnology">pump into their weapons for an even bigger punch</a>, but are even <em>more</em> vulnerable to enemy fire.

This trait was cast aside in "EX Team Rocket Returns," however, as the Dark PokÃ©mon in that set were just as hardy as anything else. Nevertheless, there are still a few specific species of PokÃ©mon whose HP are lower than other fully evolved PokÃ©mon from their sets but make up for it with other means, such as Raticate, Delcatty, Castform, and Durant.

On the other hand, when uncloaked, it is no more durable than a humble Z-95 that costs considerably less.

</li><li> Absolute Zero and Nightmist are actually very effective tanks...if they can get their key equipment out and keep it out. If they can't, then their playstyles, which rely around punching themselves in the face in various ways, will end very, very badly for them.
</li><li> The Wraith has very little damage resistance, a HP in the mid-twenties, and is very dependent on her equipment. When said equipment is out, even without buffs from anyone else, she can deal a surprising amount of damage.
</li><li> Setback is a heavily randomised hero, who <em>can</em>, with the right cards out, potentially have the best heal in the game; he has an Ongoing that puts him on a HP equal to his Unlucky pool when he would otherwise die. He also has cards that cause him to hit himself as well as the enemy, cards that give him bonuses but cause him to take damage if his Unlucky pool gets too high, and an Ongoing that gives him bonus damage equal to 1/3 of his Unlucky pool, but also increases damage directed at him by the same amount, which can lead to the right card play at high Unlucky doing 15+ damage.
</li><li> Fanatic tends to take risks with her HP and rely on her life-restoring armour and access to healing effects to avoid this being lethal; Sacrosanct Martyr and her Prime Wardens version's power, in particular, reduce her HP in exchange for damage output or free plays/power uses, and another card of hers lets her discard 3 to deal damage equal to the health she's lost â€” one of the few cards that can deal over 20 damage in one shot without any buffs at all, but only if she's on the edge of death.
</li><li> Lifeline relies <em>heavily</em> on cards that deal at least a little damage to him, and can choose to lean into the high-risk, high-reward playstyle with Cosmic Immolation, a +2 boost to all damage he deals and takes. The 1-3 turns you'll have with him after pulling that one will be destructive indeed, and then he will be twisted into a pretzel.
</li><li> KNYFE has a few cards that hurt her for extra plays/power uses, extremely weak defensive options such as damage reduction that only works against one enemy, no healing...and the ability to hit like a truck. She actually has a reasonable HP pool, but this is offset by all of her other defensive vulnerabilities.

Every chess piece is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>, but Knights have a unique move that allows them to capture pieces without fear of threat and hop over normally-reliable defenses.

However, that unique move <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">happens to be the Knight's only style of movement</a> â€” meaning if another piece aside from another Knight threatens it, the Knight has no way to fight back aside from fleeing.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Diplomacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Diplomacy">Diplomacy</a></em>, Austria and Germany are considered high-risk/high-reward countries to play due to their central location on the board: Germany can be attacked by five out of six rivals in the first year, and Austria is statistically the most likely country to be eliminated in tournament play. However, if Germany is able to form a good alliance (especially with either England or France) and Austria is able to weather the storm and scramble for the Balkans early on, they can become strong contenders for an outright victory. Russia also qualifies for Glass Cannon status due to its size (it starts with one more unit than other players) and tendency to be feast-or-famine in tournament play (it wins outright at a fair clip but is also the second-most likely country eliminated).

<ul><li> Since the introduction of gunpowder in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighMiddleAges">The High Middle Ages</a>, artillery is (probably) the very first and oldest definition of this trope: deadly when given a chance to attack from a safe distance but easily neutralized by the destruction of its crew and/or the cannon itself.
</li><li> Between the development of practical firearms and bulletproof body armor, armor became obsolete so armies just stopped using it. Similarly, although muskets were often unreliable and inaccurate over long distances, bullets could rip flesh and shatter bone if they hit. Everyone could either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> their enemy or be OHK'd themselves.
</li><li> Before gunpowder, there were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatteringRam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatteringRam">Battering Rams</a>, whose only functionality and purpose was to knock down walls. They were slow and heavy, and unless they were constructed with an outer shell, they were completely helpless against ranged and melee combatants. When carried by people, as opposed to supported by ropes or chains, those carrying the ram would be defenseless themselves, as both their hands would be occupied. In spite of these drawbacks, they continue to be used by modern-day police forces and fire brigades to enter locked doors; the latter even benefits from being used in a non-combat context, with the raw power of the battering ram only helping them in their goal to extinguish the fire as soon as possible.
</li><li> Most anti-tank weapons teams count as this. Whether armed with an anti-tank rifle, manning an anti-tank gun, or carrying around a guided missile launcher, they have the power to potentially destroy an enemy tank before it gets the chance to destroy them. However, they lack any protection other than their firearms, and the sheer bulk of their weaponry limits their mobility, making them easy targets if detected.

Popular back in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">WW2</a>, they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a> â€” usually armed with a tank-grade <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BFG</a> to destroy enemy vehicles with great efficiency, using the element of surprise. However, their limitations compared to regular tanks (lack of armour, a gun with limited traverse, or both) make them vulnerable to a well-coordinated counterattack. In modern warfare, the role of tank destroyer has been taken up by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">helicopter gunships</a>, though a number of lighter vehicles have been adapted to the purpose as well.
<ul><li> Modern wheeled tank destroyers are armed with large calibre guns and very mobile, though lacking in armour. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">They're not supposed to take on enemy tanks unless necessary</a>, as their main missions are tactical reconnaissance and fire support.
</li><li> American tank destroyers during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> in particular were <em>very</em> lightly armored, in most cases lacking a roof for their turret which exposed the crew to all kinds of nastiness. They usually mounted a relatively powerful anti-tank gun in a fully-traversing turret and were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">extremely fast</a>: the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M18_Hellcat">M18 Hellcat<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> can clock up to 55 mph on good roads. (That's 88 km/h for the rest of the world.) Conversely, M36 Jackson sported a 90 mm M3 cannon, which was able to defeat <em>any</em> German armour at <em>any</em> distance. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">Last Jacksons</a> participated in the Yugoslavian Wars of Disintegration and were finally phased out in 2002.
</li><li> Though the German and Soviet tank destroyers tended to go in the opposite direction, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">heavy armour and powerful guns with limited traverse</a>, they also produced a large number of lightly-armoured, open-topped self-propelled guns which were often used to take out enemy armour. In the case of Germany, some of these were specifically designed and pressed into service as tank destroyers, following their encounters with superior Soviet armour.
</li></ul></li><li> This a big reason that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi">USMC</a> didn't adopt the Fairbairn-Sykes Fighting Knife (and its derivative Marine Raider Stiletto) for general issue during WWII. While the needle point profile was excellent for killing things with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice">a stab in the right place</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">it was too fragile to do anything else</a> when compared to the more durable spear point profile. Because of the shortcomings in its design, the Ka-Bar knife was issued to the Marine Corps in 1942, as it was simply more versatile.
</li><li> The Swedish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThirtyYearsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThirtyYearsWar">Thirty Years' War</a> era <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather_cannon">Leather Cannon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It was basically a copper barrel wrapped on stout leather, like cow hide. The idea was to make the cannon light enough to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">mobile</a> and easily carried, which it was. It weighed 40 kg (90 lb) and could easily be carried by two men. Unfortunately it also was prone on over-heatingâ€”leather is a good heat insulatorâ€”and tended to burst if three or more shots were shot in succession without letting the barrel cool down a bit. Purely as a weapon it was a failure, but as a concept it revolutionized the role of the field artillery.
<ul><li> This was excellently highlighted in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">MythBusters</a></em>, where the cannon was recreated and fired. Their prototype replica cannon successfully damaged the targets, but broke on the first firing. They still considered it a successful recreation because the output of the cannon was comparable to a period iron cannon, and because of its historical reliability issues.
</li></ul></li><li> Aircraft carriers exist to operate aircraft. Anything not related to operating aircraft is usually considered unnecessary, as the embarked aircraft give the carrier the effective ability to spot and engage enemy targets in a radius of several hundred miles or more. That they also tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">crammed full of munitions and volatile aviation fuel</a> is just icing on the cake. Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> by Japanese WWII carriers, which had an enormous airplane capacity, but tended to ignite violently on two or three hits, largely because of poor damage control and internal design. They attempted to rectify this with Taiho, with the design expected to remain able to operate after multiple bomb and torpedo hits. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">A single American submarine-launched torpedo caused a fuel vapor explosion that sank her</a>. Modern day aircraft try to subvert this by loading them up with the best anti-air and anti-submarine defenses possible, but hold superiority mostly due to just how huge the ship is and how deadly the aircraft and how precise the targeting and sonar systems are.
</li><li> The American Northampton, Portland, and New Orleans class heavy cruisers, designed in the 1920s and '30s, were particularly infamous examples of this. These ships were designed as light cruisers under the WWI definition with nominal armor and heavy 8" guns, but were reclassified as heavy cruisers as a result of the Washington and London naval treaties due to their gun calibers. These ships suffered horrendous losses during the war due to their inadequate protection, including three being sunk with within two hours during the Battle of Savo Island in 1942.
<ul><li> "Treaty Cruisers" of this era (so named because the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 placed strict limits of 10,000 tons displacement and 8" / 203mm gun caliber on cruisers, and the the London Naval Treaty of 1930 refined this by codifying the difference between heavy and light cruisers) were almost all glass cannons. The tonnage limit made it nearly impossible to build a truly balanced heavy cruiser, with enough armor to have any meaningful defense against its own guns. The only way to achieve heavy cruiser with acceptable firepower and also acceptable armor was by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCheatingUnlessYouGetCaught" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCheatingUnlessYouGetCaught">building them significantly heavier than was legal and then lying about it</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Light tanks by definition are supposed to be very mobile, primarily designed for scouting and exploiting breakthroughs in enemy lines, so they would often give up armour in exchange for greater speed and range. Although many fall under the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> category, several designs (particularly the American M24 Chaffee and M41 Bulldog, as well as the French AMX-13 series) qualify as Glass Cannons, having sufficient armament to tackle heavier armour.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3ik13');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3ik13" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3ik13');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A few designs, namely a number of WWII French tanks, would invert this completely by being relatively slow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Walls</a>.</span> A good example would be the British "Crusader" cruiser tank: extremely fast and agile and armoured with the superb 6 pounder 57 mm cannon, which was able to knock out <em>any</em> German tanks at the desert, but itself vulnerable.
<ul><li> The American M551 Sheridan (technically an "armoured reconnaissance/airborne assault vehicle") provides a remarkable example of this trope, being poorly armoured but armed with a low-velocity 152mm gun. Put into context, its shells packed almost as much explosive as heavy artillery shells. It could also fire anti-tank missiles, which could theoretically take out any contemporary battle tank, though these were almost never used.
</li><li> The Soviet BT-series tanks were among the fastest tank designs of WWII, and were also fairly well-armed for their time with a high-velocity 45mm gun. They could reach speeds of up to 72 km/h on good roads, and had good range to boot. However, their light armor couldn't protect against anything much more powerful than rifle-caliber gunfire.
<ul><li> BTs were actually the typical European "cruiser tanks", that were envisioned to work much like the horse cavalry as a raiding and attack force, and thus featured high mobility<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4xatf');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4xatf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4xatf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Their very designation means "Fast Tank"</span> and firepower at the expense of the protection, unlike the "infantry tanks" that were planned to advance in the infantry ranks against the enemy fire and so were heavily armored but slow. These narrow niches were, however, proven to be impractical in the actual fighting, and the later types become much more balanced machines.
</li><li> In the 1930s, the Soviet Union experimented with mounting rockets on tanks, producing <a class="urllink" href="http://epizodsspace.airbase.ru/bibl/shirokorad/ot-min/244.jpg">this monstrosity<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>â—Š</small>. Due to several defects with the design (namely horrifying lack of accuracy), it was never put into production.
</li></ul></li><li> The modern Russian Sprut-SD(P) light tank is basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">T-90 125-mm smoothbore cannon</a> put into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomePersonnelCarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomePersonnelCarrier">BMD-3 APC chassis</a>. It packs a huge kick, is extemely fast and nimble, and is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsRainingMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsRainingMen">air-droppable</a>, being envisioned as a paratroopers' own tank destroyer, but its thin aluminum shell can't really take anything much above the small arms fire.
</li></ul></li><li> Main Battle Tank design took something of a detour in this direction during the 1960s, at least in Western Europe. Confronted with widespread HEAT weapons, against which steel armor required prohibitive thickness to stop, the designers of the French AMX-30 and German Leopard I dispensed with the heavy steel armor of many contemporaries in favor of greater mobility afforded by the lighter weight. Not that they were un-armored, mind you, but they were emphatically not designed to take hits from anything larger than autocannon and keep trucking. This detour ended in the 1970s with the development of composite and reactive armors, which could provide protection against HEAT weapons without prohibitive weight costs.
</li><li> Missile transporter-erector launchers are arguably the ultimate example of Glass Cannons in real life, being armed with a weapon that can wipe out a small town but completely lacking any means of self-defence. With that said, the concept inverts this in that the launchers are hard to track down and can relocate after firing.
</li><li> For much of their existence, submarines have proven to be exceptionally deadly against ships, utilizing their stealth to sneak up on surface vessels and sink them before the latter can react. However, if they are detected before they have a chance to fire, submarines pretty much lose the only advantage they have.
<ul><li> Ballistic missile submarines take the concept to an extreme, in that they are armed with enough nuclear weapons to vaporize a small country, though are virtually incapable of defending themselves if detected.
</li></ul></li><li> Torpedo boats were essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">small but inexpensive vessels armed with torpedoes</a>, and later on destroyers after the later took the role of the former. They have sometimes managed to sink even vessels as heavy as battleships, they also were highly vulnerable to gunfire from larger ships, especially WWII Japanese ones with their explosive "Long Lance" torpedoes.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Monitor_%28warship%29#World_War_I">WWI style Monitors<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> were shallow draft ships of questionable seaworthiness onto which the largest spare gun(s) at hand was crammed. Basically a floating artillery battery, they had the advantage of being cheap and able to get in very close to shore where traditional naval ships could not go, even going up rivers.
</li><li> Anything the Finnish Navy can throw in. Their ships are crammed with oversized guns and missiles, and outfitted with minelaying equipment, but have no armor whatsoever â€” they rather employ hiding in the archipelago as their defensive strategy. It helps that Finland has one of the most diabolical archipelagoes and littoral waters in the world. There is always a small island behind which you can hide.
</li><li> Japanese cruisers during WWII. They had excellent firepower, especially thanks to their long-range torpedoes already mentioned above. However even if they were not badly armored a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint">lucky hit on</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">the torpedo launchers</a> could be enough to disable or even sink them, as happened during the Battle off Samar. Japanese torpedoes used highly-compressed pure oxygen as its fuel oxidizer rather than the typical compressed air used by other nations. This allowed the infamous Type 93 "Long Lance" torpedo to be faster and longer-ranged than other torpedoes despite being larger and carrying a much heavier warhead, and also made them nearly invisible in the water since they produced no wake. But oxygen is also intensely flammable, so having the air tanks filled with pure oxygen instead of 21% oxygen and 78% inert nitrogen meant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">any explosion near the torpedoes would set them on fire and detonate their large warheads</a>.
</li><li> Japanese aircraft during the early stages of WWII; while fast for the early 1940s and well armed, they had next to no armor or safety features such as self-sealing fuel tanks or armored glass to protect pilots and crew. While some Allied designs were notorious for taking hundreds if not thousands of rounds of ammunition and still flying, even a short burst of gunfire would be enough to set a Zero ablaze and generally take its pilot with it. Later designs had armor and speed to match next generation Allied fighters, but by that point Japan had lost the best of its pilots and could only send up half-trained rookies to fight.
</li><li> Humans are generally a race of Glass Cannons in that our technological ability to inflict damage is much greater than our technological ability to defend against damage. They had to build NORAD inside a small mountain to <em>maybe</em> protect it against nukes. On the purely physical level, with peak physical training, you can dead-lift hundreds of pounds, fight several other people or animals at once, and even kill with your bare hands if need be. But you have no natural external armor, and your vital organs are still vital and vulnerable to nasty things such as being stabbed or shot.
</li><li> Many venomous snakes and bugs can seriously injure or even kill with a single bite/sting. but with the snakes, the second you grab the back the head or they run out of venom, all they can do is wriggle helplessly or try to escape. It's even worse for the arthropods, since if you can see them coming, all it would take is a shoe or a newspaper to take them out. Of course, not needing defenses is much the point of having venom in the first place; the reason so many are brightly colored is that they realize the threat of injury is a much more effective deterrent than most any physical defense.
</li><li> Small dromaeosaurs such as <em>Velociraptor</em> had a sickle claw on their feet that could deal grave damage and bleeding to prey, especially if they managed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlashedThroat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlashedThroat">slash a prey's throat</a>. However, thanks to their small size, one good hit from a larger dinosaur could gravely injure or even kill them.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponizedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponizedCar">technical</a>, basically a four-wheel pickup truck with a weapon mounted in its bed. It's quite speedy and maneuverable, and thanks to its heavy weapons (which have historically included things like rocket pods, anti-aircraft cannons, and turrets from proper fighting vehicles), it can be a terror to even armored vehicles if it gets the drop on them. It also has the armor of, well... a pickup truck.
<ul><li> Historically, the "technical" evolved out of the <em>portÃ©e</em> anti-tank guns used in WW2. This concept was evolved independently by Britain and Germany and was seen as an expedient to get the best possible use out of their standard towed guns, in the wide-open spaces of North Africa and Russia. The standard British AT gun, the two-pounder, was over-engineered and its carriage was simply too fragile to withstand being towed across rocky North African terrain. Britain got round this by scrapping the carriages and welding the gun assembly into the cargo-bed of the trucks that had once towed them, creating a fast and manoevrable self-propelled gun which remained vulnerable to counter-fire. Germany did likewise with many of its PaK 35 37mm weapons. When the USA entered the war in 1942, it copied the idea by marrying its 37mm anti-tank gun to the cargo bed of light trucks, usually the Dodge 3/4 tonner.
</li><li> The Willys MB were often converted to combat vehicles, most notably by the SAS "Desert Rats" in North Africa; the nimble little vehicles could be mounted with a <em>staggering</em> amount of firepower, including but not limited to Tommy Guns, twin Vickers .30 cal machine guns, M2 <em>50 caliber</em> machine guns, and even <em>bazookas</em>, and usually carried all these weapons <em>all at once</em> to rain absolute hell on German bases. However, the core vehicle was still the humble Jeep, which typically had armor measuring between nil and none. For this reason, the Desert Rats would operate primarily at night, forming raiding parties that would rush in, cause as much damage as possible, and then rush out before the enemy even knew what hit them.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macuahuitl">Macuahuitl<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a pre-Spanish-conquest-era Meso-American weapon which is essentially a large wooden club embedded with obsidian blades. Said obsidian blades make for a deadly weapon capable of easily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead">blowing off a person's head</a>, and it was even capable of decapitating <em>horses</em>. Unfortunately, obsidian is very brittle in comparison to steel, so these blades easily shattered if they hit anything hard enough such as steel plating/blades.
</li><li> Generally speaking, octopuses have a smorgasbord of tools and skills for killing prey. Most species have: a very sharp beak, excellent camouflage, the ability to squeeze through small holes, and incredible intelligence. Some species even have <em>venom</em>, and there's still more. However, their soft, squishy bodies make them <em>very</em> vulnerable to predators like sharks and large fish. Some, like the coconut octopus, use coconut shells or seashells to defend themselves, as those things are much harder than their bodies.
