There's a reason it's called a "confidence trick", after all.
</p><p>All con-games rely on misdirection to some degree. In most, the conman wants the victim to believe that it's not a con at all. But in a Kansas City Shuffle, the conman:
</p><p></p><dl><dd><ol><li> Needs the victim to suspect that they are involved in a con-game.
</li><li> Needs the victim to think that they've figured out how to beat the con.
</li><li> Needs the victim to be wrong about what the con is.
</li></ol></dd></dl><p><em>All three elements must be present.</em> If the victim doesn't suspect that they're being conned, it's not a Kansas City Shuffle. If the victim doesn't set themselves up for the real con by doing something to beat the con they think they've spotted, it's not a Kansas City Shuffle. If the victim is right about what the real con is, it's not a Kansas City Shuffle (though it might have been a failed attempt at one).
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>A con can be complicated without being a Kansas City Shuffle, and not all Kansas City Shuffles are complicated. It's also not a Kansas City Shuffle just because the mark goes into the situation aware that <em>something</em> dishonest is going on: most cons are built around convincing the mark that he has an opportunity to benefit from something a bit under the table. To qualify as a Kansas City Shuffle, the mark has to think they've figured out how the con works and  by attempting to outmaneuver or outsmart it  walk right into the <em>real</em> trap.
</p><p>The audience may or may not be in on the secret themselves. If they are then it can lead to a buildup of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony">Dramatic Irony</a> but often the truth can be saved to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> after the audience has been immersed in the intricacies of the apparent plot so that the shock to the character and the audience match.

After that he challenges Rakan to a show of strength and while Rakan assumes Negi will either throw a lightning spear at him or nullify Rakan's attack with Asuna's sword, he actually does nothing but activate the spell circle he'd set up beforehand so he could absorb the attack and increase his offenses enough to actually hurt Rakan.</span>

</li><li> Round 4, both Yokoya and Harimoto think that Akiyama is trying to dominate the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">chairs game, when in fact he was trying to lay his hands on the winning medals.</span>

Lelouch instead engineers a situation (as part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">Xanatos Gambit</a>) in which he <em>saves</em> Rolo's life and then to top it off gives CC to him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">knowing</a> that Rolo's desire for family will cause him to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> if he believes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Lelouch</a> actually cares about him.
<ul><li> It actually becomes a major plot point later, because the con was SO effective, that even when Lelouch explicitly told Rolo everything he said was lies, Rolo doesn't actually believe him and winds up sacrificing himself to allow Lelouch to escape.
</li><li> His <em>father</em> does the same.

Whoever's candle burns out first is the loser, and as other characters point out, it's obvious that there's a trick, but impossible to tell whether the longer candle has been tampered with, or if the lopsided choice is meant to trick Gon into falsely suspecting that it has. It turns out that the villain just has a second pair of candles down the back of his shirt and switches them out so he gives Gon an oil-soaked candle whichever he picks.

</li><li> Frequently used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> During the Land of Waves arc, Sasuke uses the shadow shuriken technique, which involves aiming a shuriken at the enemy, with another shuriken hiding in its shadow. His enemy, Zabuza, sees through this and dodges both shuriken. It turns out he used the shadow shuriken just to distract Zabuza from the actual plan, which was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Naruto had transformed into the shadow shuriken.</span>
</li><li> In the Chuunin Exam Arc, Sasuke makes up a long and complex password for the team to say in case anyone tries to impersonate a team member. Naruto gets separated from the group, and when he returns, says the password. Sasuke then realizes that he's actually an imposter. The real plan was to see if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImposterForgotOneDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImposterForgotOneDetail">imposter could remember the password correctly</a>, as there was no way the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">real</a></em> Naruto would ever remember the whole password (Sure enough, when the real Naruto shows up, he has forgotten the password).
</li><li> In the same arc, during his fight against Temari, Shikamaru throws his kunai-laden jacket into the air. Temari (and Shikamaru's teacher Asuma) assumes this is to draw her attention away from the ground so that he can trap her with the Shadow Imitation technique. His actual goal was to force her into a position from where he can make use of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a hole in the ground <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">dug earlier</a> by Naruto</span> to increase the range of his technique.
</li><li> And later during the Sasuke Recovery Mission Arc, the Sound Four place an obvious wire trap that Naruto steps over but just before he puts his foot down Shikamaru spots a second almost invisible wire and stops Naruto from stepping on it. Later when they catch up to the Sound Four it turns out that the Sound Four detected them coming and Shikamaru realizes that there was actually a third wire that was totally invisible.
</li><li> During the Pain's Invasion of Konoha arc, Naruto uses smoke bombs and then sends a Rasenshuriken at Pain's Preta Path through the smoke. The Preta Path, which has the ability to absorb any ninjutsu, absorbs the Rasenshuriken. However, the Rasenshuriken was actually Naruto's transformation jutsu. Since the transformation jutsu gets absorbed, Naruto returns to his original form, and physically holds down the Preta Path. It turns out that this trick was not his actual target, it was a distraction to prevent Pain from noticing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a couple of Naruto shadow clones flying with a giant Rasengan each aiming for the Naraka Path.</span>
</li><li> In one of the fillers for the 4th Shinobi War, a group of Redshirts are fleeing from an Edo Tensei zombie who just wiped out their squad. While fleeing, they place some obvious traps along the way. What a bunch of cowards, right? It turns out they were using those to get Ringo to let her guard down so they could lure her into quicksand as revenge. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee">As is usual for Naruto, the audience didn't see it coming, and thought the Redshirt leader was a legit coward</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Diplomacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Diplomacy">Diplomacy</a></em> is a game which consists of seven players guiding European powers through maneuver and negotiation to power. Gameplay consists of rounds of secret negotiations, then writing down one's moves and resolving any conflicts. Since the only mechanic for resolving combat is building alliances, and there is only one winner, every player is always suspecting a con. How you use this atmosphere of suspicion and distrust is up to you. One example: Alice could try to convince Bob to support an action in exchange for mutual support, but Bob refuses, believing he's being suckered. When it's time to write down moves, Alice supports Bob <em>anyway</em>, then acts betrayed when Bob doesn't support her. Bob is now seen as unreliable by Charlie, David, Eve, Trent, and Walter. Alice looks reliable. The reality is, of course, backwards.
</li><li> A little-known boardgame called "<em>Lie, Cheat, and Steal</em>" is essentially a Kansas City Shuffle variant of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Monopoly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Monopoly">Monopoly</a></em>. The only restriction that the rules place on dishonest play is that no-one may directly steal from the bank. When you draw the equivalent of a "Chance" or "Community Chest" card, you don't have to tell the truth about what it says. Other players can challenge your claim, but if they're wrong and you were telling the truth about what it said, they are penalized. As with other games of this nature, the skill lies in convincing the other players that you're lying when you're really telling the truth, to the point that they become wary of challenging you at all, even when they should.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Card Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Poker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Poker">Poker</a> lends itself naturally to these. One example is for a player who is holding a strong hand to pull players into the pot. Since (smart) players should pull out from a pot if they know their opponent is strong, a player holding "the nuts" (an unbeatable hand) has to look like he isn't. A player who's bluffing is trying to scare everyone out of the pot and is lying. A player with a strong hand or the nuts could try to look like he's pulling one con (bluffing) while really hoping people "call his bluff." If that player has read books of tells, for example, he could purposefully try to act like a player with "normal" tells to look like he's bluffing. It works best against the half-smart. Really good players may have it figured out, and poker players know "bluffing a monkey," or pretending to bluff a monkey, is a waste of time.
</li><li> Bullshit (also known as "Cheat", "Shenanigans", or "I Doubt It" — particularly when teaching it to kids) is a card game where players bid books of cards from one to four of a certain number. For example, Alice could bid "One two," and place a two face down on the pile of cards. Bob plays next and could bid, "Three twos," playing three cards on the stack. Players can call "Bullshit!" which forces you to prove your play was legal. If it was, the player who called "Bullshit!" picks up the stack of cards. If it was not legal, you pick up the stack. The object is to empty your hand of all cards. One key component is to make your big bids ("Four fives") in ways where your opponent calls "Bullshit!" when it's real (thereby getting stuck with the cards), often enough that they decline to call it at all, which allows you to dump actual "bullshit" plays.
<ul><li> One particularly tricky tactic, which may or may not be allowed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules">House Rules</a>, is to play more cards than are actually declared. For example, Bob bids "three twos" but actually plays four cards. If Alice calls his bluff and checks the top three cards (which are the aforementioned twos), she would be obliged to take the stack. Only if Bob is sloppy with his sleight-of-hand, or Alice is savvy enough to check the next card on the stack and find out that it's not what the previous player played, would he lose the bluff. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules">House Rules</a> may either make that play illegal, and/or force a player to play the cards in front of them <em>before</em> adding them to the stack (giving a fair chance for the other players to call the bluff, and also making it easier to tell when a player has attempted this move).
</li><li> Similar games include variations on Liar's Dice and other such dice games, such as Mia.
</li><li> The card game The Great Dalmuti operates on very similar mechanics, with the added incentive that victory or defeat enhances or demotes players' position around the table. The game is built specifically for tactics like the Kansas City Shuffle.
</li></ul></li><li> A significant amount of the difference between a good <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> player and a pro is not in their deck, but in their ability to play mind games like this. For example, an attacking player may bluff having combat tricks (spells playable during the game's combat phase that make your creatures stronger or better) to try to trick the opponent into an unfavorable block, or to convince a player to play around a counterspell he doesn't have.

Scrooge lets a spy see him hide the money inside carpets he takes with him, while he sends the safe he had with him ahead by a train. The bandits figure the safe must be a ruse, especially when the railways are hardly reliable, and attack him on the way back and open up the carpet rolls — which are empty, of course, and Scrooge asks whether the bandit lord hadn't noticed his sending the safe along before. The bandits rush ahead to stop the train, only to find the safe empty when they finally get it open. Meanwhile, Donald, whom no-one was paying attention to at this point, has made his way back to the border alone, with the money hidden inside some jugs. So, the trope is actually applied doubly; even once they know it was a Kansas City Shuffle, they're still wrong about how the con works, and trying to beat it still only gets them out of the way.

When a Chinese cart loaded with rice sacks approaches, the suspicious guards run their bayonets through the sacks. Shortly after this, a Japanese armored car rolls up and tells the guards that Tintin escaped by hiding in one of the sacks. The lieutenant is confused as to how Tintin could have escaped this way.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Duplicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Duplicity">Duplicity</a></em> - The whole movie is about a pair of ex-spies hired by industrialist Dick Garsik to infiltrate his archrival Howard Tully's company and steal his mysterious new product. The spies, meanwhile, are plotting to betray Garsik (and perhaps each other) and take the product for themselves. The shuffle: Tully has no product. He knew all about the spies, and set up an elaborate hoax to waste their time and make Garsik look foolish. At the end, Garsik is announcing the miraculous new cure for baldness he just "developed" to the world, while the spies' buyer tells them that their "cure" is a worthless formula for skin lotion...
</li><li> The 1959 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HouseOnHauntedHill1959" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HouseOnHauntedHill1959">House on Haunted Hill</a></em> is essentially a whole load of characters going around trying to trap and falling into the traps of others. We can particularly point out the trope use in the use of the characters who are playing dead. In Annabelle's case it is a simple misdirection as part of the plot in which she is involved. However when Vincent Price's character reveals himself to have not only been playing dead but also been playing along with his wife's entire plot to just switch out key elements so that it turns back on her, <em>that</em> takes the biscuit.

Todd correctly assumes Scott is trying to trick him and reads Scott's mind, "discovering" that he put half-n-half in the cup he's offering. However, Scott in fact put half-n-half in the cup he's <em>not</em> offering to Todd, and "thought real hard" about putting half-n-half in the cup he originally offered. This wouldn't have worked, though, had Todd not already had two strikes against him for eating gelato ("It's milk and eggs, bitch") and chicken ("Chicken's not vegan?"). The half-n-half makes it a third strike.

<ul><li> Superman, at the Fortress of Solitude, uses a rare heroic instance to render Zod, Ursa and Non powerless:
<div class="indent"><strong>Superman:</strong> <em>[whispering to Luthor]</em> Try and get them all into this molecule chamber; it turns them all into ordinary human beings, see, and it takes away their powers. Now if you could— <br/><strong>Lex Luthor:</strong> General, don't go in there, it's a trap. <br/><strong>Superman:</strong> Luthor, you poisonous snake! <br/><strong>Lex Luthor:</strong> That's a molecule chamber. It turns people like you into people like me. <br/><strong>General Zod:</strong> You've done well, Lex Luthor. <br/><strong>Lex Luthor:</strong> The crystal there activates the mechanism. <br/><strong>General Zod:</strong> Lex Luthor, ruler of Australia, activate the machine.
</div></li><li> Superman goes into a chamber, which actually shields him from the effects of the red solar rays, which unbeknownst to Zod, Ursa, and Non, deprives them of their Kryptonian super powers. As soon as General Zod demands that Superman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KneelBeforeZod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KneelBeforeZod">pledge his loyalty to him</a>, the Man of Steel crushes Zod's now-mortal body, and his partners-in-crime meet their demise soon afterwards.

</div></li><li> Nevertheless, Superman remains unimpressed by Lex Luthor's devious attempts when the Man of Steel calls Luthor's bluff:
<div class="indent"><strong>Superman:</strong> I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance. <br/><strong>Lex Luthor:</strong> Me? Are you kidding?

It is noted to be akin to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Dangerous Forbidden Technique</a>, because if the thief slips for even a moment, the target will realize the trick.

</li><li> The entire plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WildThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WildThings">Wild Things</a></em> revolves around Suzie convincing the other conspirators into thinking they know what the con is. Kelly thinks she and Sam will get rid of Suzie and run off together with the money. Ray thinks he and Sam will get rid of both girls, implicate Kelly in Suzie's murder, and split the money two-ways before parting. Sam thinks he and Suzie will frame Kelly for Suzie's "murder", kill Ray, and run off together with the money. Turns out the real plan was for Suzie to fake her own death with Sam's assistance, implicate Kelly, kill both Ray and Sam, and take <em>all</em> the money.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HouseOfGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HouseOfGames">House of Games</a></em>, the affluent heroine realizes that she's being conned and exposes the conman.

Rudy is posing as his late cellmate Nick (killed in a fight) to be with Nick's girlfriend, Ashley. Ashley's brother, Gabriel, forces "Nick" to help his gang rob the casino Nick used to work at. Rudy goes along with it as he realizes that if they don't need "Nick," Gabriel will kill him and Ashley. Here's where the Shuffle begins...
<ul><li> During an escape, Nick overhears Gabriel and Ashley talking as it turns out they're not siblings but lovers who are using "Nick" and planning to kill him anyway when this is done. Rudy plays that he's still in the dark and Ashley loves him so he can figure out a way to sabotage the robbery.
</li><li> The robbery turns into a mess with only Rudy (having his identity exposed), Gabriel and Ashley getting away. At which point, Ashley shoots Gabriel and a very much alive Nick shows up. Ashley is his real girlfriend who was using Gabriel and his gang to rob the casino and Rudy/fake-Nick suckered to take the fall while the two run off with the money.

Cue Lt. Vincent Hanna and his team heading down to the scene for additional clues, only for Hanna to realize that it was probably misinformation they were fed, and that the entire meeting was to get the detectives in the open, <em>allowing Neil to counterspy on them and learn their identities.</em> Indeed, we see Neil taking pictures of them from the same vantage point Hanna was using earlier.

Right as almost every officer available is underground, it turns out Bane set everything up so he could cause several explosions, revealing his true intent was to trap them all underground and leave Gotham undefended.

In fact, the envelope choice is to have a firecracker explode in your hand. Unfortunately for Peter, the "firecracker" in question is a massive M-80 duct-taped to his hand - most of which he loses in the explosion.

<ul><li> A little Mexican boy rides his bicycle up to a border control station with a sack slung over one shoulder. The American agent working the station checks out his papers and asks to search his bag, but the boy tells him that it's full of sand. The agent searches the bag and finds out that it really <em>is</em> full of sand, but he gets suspicious and confiscates it anyway. This goes on for several months, with the boy regularly crossing the border on his bicycle with his bag of sand, and the agent confiscating it every time. Then one day, years after the agent has retired, he meets the boy in a bar in Texas. "I know you had to have been up to something," he tells the boy. "I'm off the job now. Can you tell me what you were trying to smuggle all that time?" The boy just grins and says, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathNotice">Bicycles</a>."
<ul><li> Variation: "Wheelbarrows."

</li><li> A fairly regular occurrence in Jim Butcher's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhiteNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhiteNight">White Night</a></em>, Lara Raith suggested to a member of another family in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils">the White Court</a> that they should kill off weak female magical practitioners. She did this so that she could rope the other White Court family into the scheme because she knew that eventually Harry Dresden would get involved and generally smash everyone in sight before he realized she came up with the whole thing. He didn't realize until he'd already played straight into the plot because what this amounted to was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">a ruler of a vampire court deliberately getting their minions to try to supplant the ruler</a></em> and then having them destroyed without having to lift a finger herself.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallFavor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallFavor">Small Favor</a></em>, the Order of the Blackened Denarius kidnap a freeholding lord, a recent signatory to the Unseelie Accords, simultaneously threatening that lord, disrupting his power base, and placing the Order in violation of the Accords (thus challenging the weakened White Council to choose risking a multi-front war if they enforce the Accords, and offending the Unseelie Court if they don't). Harry manipulates the White Council into acting, selecting a particular character as arbiter which is what the Order wanted, as it made her vulnerable to a kidnap attempt.
<ul><li> There's a less visible example (because it doesn't involve the protagonists) going on at the same time. There's an ongoing power struggle which resumes any time most of the Order get together, and while this plot stands to benefit the entire Order at each stage Nicodemus is clearly either increasing his own influence or setting up potential future problems for rivals. This is obvious to the rest of the Order, as is that they're all being given rope to oppose or betray his "side" without really ruining the plot, implying he's in some way preparing a personal "traitor sweep". What's <em>not</em> obvious is that the situation's set up to look for a member of the Order sabotaging the <em>entire plot</em> to do irreparable damage to their mutual goals - he suspects Outsider infiltration, and the situation is designed to spur such an infiltrator to act; nobody will be willing to get together afterwards to honestly compare who did what when if the damage looks like the fallout of "normal" betrayals. While it's unclear how much good it does him, Nicodemus walks away from the affair with confirmation of this and the identity of their puppet.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkinGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkinGame">Skin Game</a></em>, Mab charges Harry with repaying a debt to Nicodemus Archleone by helping him steal the Holy Grail from Hades' vault in the Underworld, along with a crew of other people Nicodemus hired for the job. After setting it up, Mab tells Harry that it's a setup: she only intends for Harry to help him get the Grail; she never said anything about what Harry would do after he got his hands on it. Both Harry and Nicodemus figure that the other is going to betray him as soon as Nicodemus obtains the Grail, so Harry asks for a second person to watch his back, while Nicodemus has secretly given Coins to Hannah Ascher and the Genoskwa (Lasciel and Ursiel, respectively, and hired Goodman Grey for the secondary reason of helping him kill Harry when it comes time. However, it is later revealed that Harry figured out that Grey was the only person Nicodemus could hire to get access to the location where the Way to Hades' vault could be opened, and secretly hired him first, with the purpose of turning on Nicodemus after he got the Grail. The resulting brouhaha leaves Nicodemus defeated and alone, with Deirdre dead by his hand (to get through the Gate of Blood), his power broken, and his reputation destroyed. Sure, he got the Grail, but he lost the item he really wanted: the knife that Christ was stabbed with while he was on the Cross, along with three other artifacts. It turns out the whole plot was a scheme by Mab and John Marcone, with Uriel and Hades' help, to get back at Nicodemus for the events of <em>Small Favor</em>.

Louis's actual plan is to smuggle himself and the Hindmost off the Ringworld and out of Tunesmith's control, since he (Louis) believes that hiding amongst the Ringworld's billions of inhabitants is actually the safest place for Wembleth to be.

For example, in the first book, he lets Ekuman know that finding and controlling the mysterious "Elephant" super-weapon is the key to holding or losing the west coast. Ekuman concludes that the resistance plans to find the Elephant and use it to destroy him, and not unreasonably decides that he has to get it first. That turns out to be exactly how Ardneh liberates the entire west coast. In the second book, the demon Zapranoth worries that Ardneh might find out where his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">life is hidden</a>, so he moves it to where he can better keep an eye on it and guard it.

The mark won't investigate Locke or their joint business venture any more since he knows it's all a scam, but at the same time Locke keeps receiving money because the mark is told that the police is about to make an arrest and if the money stops Locke will flee with all the money he already has. Obviously there will be no arrest, because the "secret police" is actually Locke and his accomplice.

Even after they suck Granny's blood and try to turn her into a vampire, they suspect Granny's used Borrowing to put part of herself elsewhere, either in Magrat's newborn daughter or into wishy-washy priest Mightily Oats.

In <em>Postal</em> he reminisces on using this with one of his old alternate identities, "lack-of-confidence trickster" Edwin Streep:
<div class="indent">He was so patently, obviously <em>bad</em> at running a bent Find-the-Lady game and other street scams that people positively queued up to trick the dumb trickster and walked away grinning... right up to the moment when they tried to spend the coins they'd scooped up so quickly... Later on they learned that Streep might be rubbish with a deck of cards but also that his lack was more than made up for by his exceptional skill as a pickpocket.
</div><ul><li> Moist does this later on in the Clacks vs. Post race against the Grand Trunk. He knows that the Trunk's chairman, Reacher Gilt, is just as much a conman as he, so he provides him with a fake con to foil. First he turns up to the race with a broomstick that has silver stars painted on it, making it seem like it is a magic broomstick and he intends to win the race by flying. When Gilt points out that this is against the rules, Lipwig points out that each Clacks tower has a horse available to deliver messages when the towers break, and that using them would be cheating as well. Thus both methods are disqualified. Gilt naturally assumes that this was Moist's plan all along, but in actuality he doesn't intend to "win" at all. At the time his plan was to alter the message to one that deigned to damage the mechanisms in the tower, and it could be countered if they sent horses to warn later towers. He ends up changing the message along the way to reveal the Trunk's treachery in front of everyone, disguised as a message from beyond the grave, instead.
</li><li> Another that he does in the story is act desperate and try to pawn a diamond. The victim then tries to rip him off, but he palms it and substitutes a fake at the last second. At one point he tries to argue to his parole officer that it shouldn't count as wrong if the victim thought they were conning <em>him</em>, but nobody's buying it.
</li><li> Gilt is using a variant. The board of the Clacks know he helped them steal the company and that the way he's running it is intended to milk it of profits in the short term; this keeps them from realizing that he's robbing them blind.

An elderly Chinese dignitary traveling on a train is accosted by a warlord who wants him dead. The dignitary offers tea, and openly adds a sweetener to his own cup. Then his niece (who is traveling with him) drops a tray and while the warlord is distracted, the dignitary clumsily pours something into the warlord's cup. The warlord insists that they trade cups before drinking. The dignitary objects, but finally acquiesces, and they trade cups and drink. The warlord is found dead in his compartment the next day — the "sweetener" was the poison, and the "poison" was simple sugar. By insisting on the cup trade, the warlord gave himself the poisoned cup.

It is basically a walkway mounted on two miniature ladders on each side, with a cube of sugar hanging from the center of the walkway. As the President explains, the fly would climb up the first ladder and would be traversing the walkway when it would catch sight of the sugar cube and become tempted by it; just before it decided to make its way down the hanging string to eat the sugar, however, it would realize that there is a bowl of water directly beneath the hanging cube, meaning that the fly would drown if it fell. As a result, the fly would continue walking over to the second ladder, feeling smug that it had avoided the water trap - until it started to descend the second ladder and fell to its death because the President had left off one of the ladder's rungs near the top.

Once District 13's leader Alma Coin realizes that Katniss is useless to their cause so long as she's worried sick about Peeta she sends in a team to retrieve him and take that ace out of Snow's deck. Turns out this is what Snow wanted them to do all along, as the torture he inflicted on Peeta included hijacking, a method of brainwashing that essentially turned Peeta into a human terminator focused only on killing Katniss.

<ul><li> The Red Ball Trick. Penn tells you beforehand <em>how the trick is done</em> (with a thread) and then storms offstage. Then for three and a half minutes you watch Teller and a red ball while you try in vain to spot the thread. Most people conclude that it's a "sucker" trick (see above), i.e. that there's actually no thread and the ball is controlled in some other way. The fact is that Teller is just <em>that good</em>; he's rehearsed it so much that even when you know the gimmick you can't <em>see</em> him doing it. Some other magicians have said that the trick is <em>even more</em> impressive to them, since they know how he's doing it and <em>still</em> can't catch him at it.
</li><li> At Penn and Teller's Las Vegas stage show, they will often remind you that the tricks they're doing aren't necessarily the tricks you think they're doing. This still doesn't stop you from being caught out, though.

When Penn starts describing the well-known techniques, they can honestly say that they did not use those techniques to perform the illusion.
</li><li> In one episode there's a sword swallower who, well, swallows a sword (first a straight one, then a curvy one). In perhaps a <em>reverse</em> case of the trope, he didn't win. He was <em>very</em> good but Penn, who had done a sword swallowing act himself in the past, explained that while he was extremely impressed by the guy's technique, it wasn't a "trick" because he <em>actually did</em> everything he said he was doing and there was no illusion or sleight-of-hand involved at all.

Kaylee figures out his plan and avoids it by planting Jenna's DNA for Jack to find and test, instead of her own (thus making Jack look like a conniving traitor for trying to mail Hank an unauthorized paternity test that doesn't prove anything). However, the only thing Hank Hooper loves more than his family is his birthday. The DNA was a distraction to prevent Kaylee from doing anything to celebrate Hank's birthday, whereas the envelope of DNA results actually contained a birthday card from Jack.

However, Dufresne decides that with their newly captured Spanish warship, they have nothing to fear from a merchant vessel, and Flint is merely trying to trick him into avoiding an easy and profitable victory that will win him popularity with the crew and cement him as the new Captain. He takes the trade route, and sure enough, they come across a vessel to plunder. But the battle goes poorly, largely due to Dufresne's lack of experience in command, and humiliates him while allowing Flint the perfect opportunity to step in and play the hero, earning the trust of the crew back. After the crew votes for Flint to return as Captain, Dufresne muses that this was what Flint had intended all along, and wonders whether they would have even considered taking the trade route home in the first place had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BriarPatching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BriarPatching">Flint not advised against it</a>.

Right at the end, Lizzie, running the DJ booth, accidentally announces Kate's movements to the room, alerting her to the plan, and Lizzie's mother (who'd been excluded from the con) steps in to give Kate her photo disk back and chide Lizzie for being silly. Kate walks away smirking at how she bested Lizzie, then it reveals that Lizzie's mom used her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsSkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsSkill">Chekhov's Skill</a> at slight-of-hand to swap out the disks, meaning she handed Kate Lizzie's disk. Though it isn't exactly clear why the subterfuge was necessary. As far as the audience could tell, they'd <em>already</em> swapped out the disks without Kate being remotely aware anything was happening. Presumably, if Lizzie hadn't alerted her, she still would have wound up with Lizzie's disk anyway. Meaning it was basically to trick the audience into thinking Lizzie got caught and complete the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> (or to make her mother feel included since she felt her talent with cards was being wasted).

<ul><li> In Season Six, a character explains to the surviving castaways that he wants them to leave the Island with him in the Ajira plane, but when the good guys ditch him and lock themselves inside Widmore's submarine in "The Candidate," it looks like they've outsmarted him...that is, until he grins and says to survivor Claire, "You don't want to be anywhere on that sub." 'Cause the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> snuck a bomb onboard. Cue the cruelest twenty minutes of the show's history, as Sayid, Jin, and Sun all perish, Lapidus is left for dead, and the four survivors barely escape and are left to sob on a beach at night. Then there is the second layer to that con. He cannot kill the castaways himself so he lets them think that he conned them into locking themselves in the submarine with a bomb. They discover the bomb before the timer runs down so they figure that they can just disarm the bomb to neutralize the trap. However, 'disarming' the bomb actually arms it so the castaways are causing their own deaths which is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a> he needed. Ironically Jack figured it out ahead of time but the experienced conman Sawyer insisted on pulling the wires on the bomb.

During the competition over the Honda Motorcycles account, the Honda execs make certain rules to ensure a level playing field: each agency is given $3000 to make boards and copy—no finished work allowed. After Roger Sterling makes a point of displaying what he thinks of the Japanese (not very much) to the visiting Honda executives, Don decides that by way of damage control, he needs to make sure Chaough doesn't use this to sail to victory. Don thus goes to great lengths to hint that SCDP is going to make a big, expensive spec commercial for Honda (which is finished work and therefore not allowed) convincing Chaough that his firm should do the same. But SCDP isn't making a commercial at all (leading to a pretty hilarious scene with <a class="urllink" href="http://i34.tinypic.com/11w6ck2.jpg">Peggy riding around an empty set on a Honda motorcycle<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>) Draper's intention was to severely damage Chaough's firm's budget by fooling them into making the big, expensive commercial. Don resigns the Honda account, returning the $3000, on the grounds that Honda had broken its own rules and he could not honorably do business with them. Chaough's firm is now a mess, and while Honda doesn't end up giving <em>anyone</em> their main motorcycle account, SCDP gets a shot at the advertising for their new automotive division.

He puts a snake in Charles' bed, puts shaving cream in Colonel Potter's toothpaste, cuts the back off of Margret's bathrobe, poisons Father Mulcahy and sets off a bomb in Klinger's filing cabinet, each one making Hawkeye increasingly paranoid. After the last two, he sets up a cot outside in a barb-wire enclosure, resulting in him getting no sleep from all the background noise. At the end everyone reveals they were in on it and either did everything themselves or simply lied to Hawkeye, and that Hawkeye was the actual victim.

<ul><li> <em>The Mind of Stefan Miklos</em> had the IMF team fooling a brilliant intelligence officer with a photographic memory, from whom it would be impossible to hide the fact that they were scamming him; the scam they actually pulled was very carefully staged so that he would draw the wrong conclusions about what he saw and what they wanted him to believe.
</li><li> In another case, they conned the warden and second-in-command of a prison with an escape-proof cell into believing that a political prisoner in the cell had been switched with a double during the distraction caused by another pair of prisoners attempting escape (when, in fact, the prisoner never left his cell). The "double" and the two "escapees" are then taken away for interrogation by some helpful state security agents who "coincidentally" happened to be present.

Turns out, the original murder victim had been killed by her date after he tried to rape her, and he needed to keep the police occupied for 36 hours so the special dessert they had ordered would deteriorate in her system and be useless as evidence to implicate him. He committed the Six-Way murder to start the serial killer scare necessary to distract the police</span>. How did Monk figure this out? Because he was bothered by the fact that the Six-Way Killer had set such an arbitrary time limit instead of 24 hours or naming a specific date and time.

He organizes a big poker game with a known Indian tech millionaire. Vince becomes convinced the guy is a ringer and the game is rigged and calls Marius on it with guns pointed. The millionaire's bodyguard pulls out his phone and announces the man is a protected informant, he's an FBI agent and has just called reinforcements. Vince openly laughs on how "this guy is dedicated to the act" and shoots him in the chest. At which point, the man reveals he has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletProofVest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletProofVest">Bulletproof Vest</a> on as he shoots Vince. As he falls, Vince hears police sirens and then agents pouring in. Too late, Vince realizes he just shot an actual federal agent which means a minimum of 20 years in prison.
<ul><li> Marius' brother is thrown as he thought the guy was a fake too. Marius tells him that the millionaire was totally for real but he knew Vince would be expecting a con. And as it happens, his team took advantage of the chaos of the raid to rob Vince's safe of millions while he heads to jail.
</li><li> The season 2 finale has Marius pulling off the heist of a buffalo statue supposedly containing $11 million stolen years ago by Maggie. Complicating things are a pair of FBI agents threatening his gang unless they help take down the vicious mobster who wants his money back. It turns out the money is not inside...which Marius had already figured out but uses the confusion to take out the mobster himself while his crew locate the boxes containing the real money from a storage facility. Then, the FBI agents are revealed to be con artists themselves as Marius was using them as cover to make the mobster think he was under coercion. But when going over the money, Marius discovers that instead of hundred dollar bills, the cash in the boxes are merely $1. He calls up Maggie who reveals she knew all along the "agents" weren't real and was using Marius to get the money...which she destroys as revenge for the mobster killing her lover. Marius' gang isn't happy that this shuffle turns what should have been a huge score into a mere pittance.

However, on route the Senator's ship explodes. Garak suspected the fake wouldn't hold up to scrutiny, and planted a bomb on the politician's ship. When the recording is found by Romulan salvage teams, its imperfections are presumed to be damage from the explosion.

The crew are able to get the Hazari on side after learning this, but they know the Think Tank won't give up trying to acquire Seven, so they have the Hazari stage an attack on Voyager as a pretext for Seven to enter the Think Tank's ship. The Think Tank's representative Kurros figures out that the Hazari's "attack" is a ruse and accesses Seven's implants in order to learn what she plans to do.

<ul><li> During World War II, during the preparation for Operation Overlord (D-Day), the allies made a series of fictional armies with objectives all across Europe (Operation Fortitude). The most well known was an army that was supposedly intending to attack the port at Calais rather than Normandy. When the Allies landed in Normandy, they were able to convince Hitler that this was a diversion to get him to move troops away from the "real" landing site at Calais—when in fact Calais was the diversion from Normandy. (Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesDeGaulle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesDeGaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a>, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedAssistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedAssistance">Charles de Gaulle</a>, let the cat out of the bag, loudly announcing the Normandy invasion to be the real thing. Fortunately, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Charles de Gaulle</a>, nobody on the other side listened to him.)
</li><li> The famous Ethiopian leader Haile Selassie (a.k.a. Ras Tafari) once pulled this off. A local warlord named Balcha Safo parked a massive army outside the city Selassie was in in an attempt to intimidate him. Selassie responded by acting submissive and inviting Safo to a dinner in his honor; Safo was certain this was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NastyParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NastyParty">trick</a>, and took 600 men from his army to go to the dinner with him and watch for any signs of foul play. Safo kept his guard up at the party at all times, which, of course, was Selassie's plan all along, because after the dinner when Safo returned to where he had camped his army, his army was nowhere to be found. While he was watching for treachery at the dinner, Selassie's men had bribed the army to leave.
</li><li> When Diamond Comic Distributors introduced a "street date" system for comics in 2011 (so that instead of being delivered on Wednesday morning, so shopkeepers had to race to get them out on the shelves, new comics would be delivered on Tuesday, with a strict rule that they could not be sold until the start of Wednesday business hours) there were mocking reports of elderly female secret shoppers trying to do trap purchases on Tuesday evenings for stereotypical fanboy-appeal comics, with fans laughing at how transparent it was. Turns out that after the little old lady walked out, a <strong>real</strong> trap purchase secret shopper dressed like a fanboy would go in...
</li><li> The famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MontyHallProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MontyHallProblem">Monty Hall Problem</a> uses this trope to illustrate probability theory. In the problem, a contestant on a game show is given the opportunity to win a new car by choosing one of three doors — one of which has a car behind it, and two of which have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zonk">goats</a> behind them. After the contestant makes his choice, the game show host opens one of the two other doors to reveal one of the two goats, then asks the contestant if he would rather choose the prize behind the third and final door, which could either be the car or the second goat. By focusing one's attention on the two remaining closed doors (one of which conceals a car, and one of which conceals a goat), the problem manages to make it look like one has a simple 50/50 chance of winning the car. In fact, the contestant has a 2 in 3 chance of choosing a goat on his first guess, but only a 1 in 3 chance of choosing the car... meaning that the contestant will always have a better chance of getting the car if he changes his choice when given the chance.
<ul><li> The contest, as seen on the original game show, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/21/us/behind-monty-hall-s-doors-puzzle-debate-and-answer.html?pagewanted=all">had a psychological element<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> too. As Monty Hall pointed out, he didn't have to let you switch. If you picked the wrong door, he could just open that door and send you home with a goat. He was more likely to let you switch if you guessed right, and he'd sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReversePsychology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReversePsychology">offer you money to stick with your original (correct) choice</a>. Contestants usually took this as proof that they were on the right track, so they'd turn down the money and get a goat for their trouble. Monty Hall concluded, "if you can get me to offer you $5,000 not to open the door, take the money and go home."
</li><li> People have written extended analyses of the problem, and the suggested rule (always switch) is mathematically sound if the host <em>always</em> reveals a goat and <em>always</em> offers a switch. If not (as was the case on the actual show) ... let's just say it's <em>much</em> harder to predict.
