But there seems to be one exception: when the victim is a man and the attacker is a woman. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts">Men are stereotyped as</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AManIsAlwaysEager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AManIsAlwaysEager">constantly wanting sex</a> and of being stronger in general than women. Therefore, the idea that the man could have either not consented to sex with a woman or been incapable of fighting off a female aggressor if he did refuse sex is simply not taken seriously. Another commonly-held notion that the idea of female-on-male rape challenges is the false idea that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotIfTheyEnjoyedItRationalization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotIfTheyEnjoyedItRationalization">since men have erections, they enjoy the sex, and hence is not rape or not as traumatic as any other kind of rape</a>.
</p><p>The consequence of this line of thought is this trope. A man raped by an attractive woman is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AManIsAlwaysEager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AManIsAlwaysEager">considered a lucky man</a>, and a man being raped by an unattractive woman is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape">comedy gold</a>.

</li><li> <em>Muscle Milk</em> is supposed to make one more attractive. Ads show men visibly upset talking about how they are being sexually harassed by women, The announcer then tells them that attractive men <em>must</em> submit to unwanted sexual advances.
</li><li> In the seventies, Hai Karate cologne stopped just short of rape, with its ads featuring a man being mobbed by women (usually between four and six women) after he uses the cologne, to the point that his clothes are torn and he's generally dishevelled and has to physically fight them off. Again, consider whether an ad for a women's scent would <em>ever</em> be marketed that way.
</li><li> In, of all things, a commercial for chocolate candies: tennis player Roger Federer is stopped in the airport by two attractive female transportation-security officials, who confiscate his candy and threaten him with a strip search. It's played for comedy, although one can't imagine a version starring (say) Maria Sharapova or Serena Williams and two <em>male</em> security people.

<ul><li> Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Kanokon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Kanokon">Kanokon</a></em>'s huge-breasted and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">foxy</a> Chizuru Minamoto, who lusts toward a cute young boy named Kouta. She has no hesitation to strip herself naked in public and rape him at any possible moment. As if this is not enough, there's a female wolf Nozumu, who's as bad as the former. Together, they form a downright weird <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a>. In the manga it eventually makes the kid become submissive and a permanent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert">Chivalrous Pervert</a>.
</li><li> In the final arc of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> manga, a mind-controled Shampoo takes advantage of the fact that Akane is helpless and in her control to force Ranma to sleep with her (as their "last memory together", since she was ordered to kill him afterwards). Surprisingly, since the series had played the reverse for laughs (involving female Ranma's mishaps) this was played seriously... until the people in the next room started eavesdropping and completely misunderstood what was going on.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlsSaurus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlsSaurus">Girls Saurus</a></em>, Shingo, who is deeply afraid of women after various bad encounters with them, is eventually cornered by a porn movie director who had been looking at his sister for a part. In order to save his sister, Shingo would have to star in a movie where he gets raped by many women. While the idea is treated with horror and revulsion by him at first, it's mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, and when he reluctantly accepts, his friends, all of them girls, all volunteer to do the scene with him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KuroganePukapukaTai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KuroganePukapukaTai">Kurogane Pukapuka Tai</a></em>'s seemingly sole heterosexual woman, gunnery officer Obama Mifuyu, seems to have this attitude to "seduction", and a taste verging on paedophilia besides.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnihimeVS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnihimeVS">Onihime VS</a></em>, the closest thing to an actual love interest the main character has is the bully who sexually assaults him on a daily basis, culminating in attempting straight-up rape after cornering him in the athletic supply closet. We're supposed to be rooting for her to end up with him, though to be fair, the other girls competing to win his heart are literally competing for his heart, the blood pumping organ in his chest, so that they can eat it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GoshuushouSamaNinomiyaKun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GoshuushouSamaNinomiyaKun">Goshuushou-sama Ninomiya-kun</a></em>'s main character, Shungo Ninomiya, is more or less completely uninterested in girls, and unwilling to fight them off, so the girls in his class love to tease him, including kidnapping and tying him down so he can't get away. Crosses the line when Reika, the girl whom the main character is oblivious about, snaps, causing her alternate, more assertive and less moral personality to take command, who promptly lures Shungo to a secluded spot, wherein she ties him down and attempts to rape him for real.
</li><li> Done in the anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedGrapher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedGrapher">Speed Grapher</a></em>, where the hero Saiga is run over by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">Inspector</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Ginza</a>. This leaves Saiga unconscious, allowing Ginza to take him to her apartment and invoke this trope.
</li><li> The original manga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em> actually introduces Urd, who has this sentiment. Upon her arrival, she is more than a little baffled at Keiichi and Belldandy's lack of... physical drive. Her attempts to "remedy" this culminate in trying to make Keiichi have sex with <em>her</em> through a combination of straightforward seduction, lies, and <em>psychically pressuring his mind</em> to give in.
</li><li> Hinted at in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelSanctuary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelSanctuary">Angel Sanctuary</a></em> as at least part of the reason Raphael's reputation was so utterly destroyed after his then-subordinate Belial <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">raped him while in his own office</span>. Public opinion was that he was nothing more than a lech that had wanted or even been a willing participant. Rather than denying it, he instead refashions himself into the very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KavorkaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KavorkaMan">Kavorka Man</a> people perceived him as.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Forever</a></em>. Tenchi is brainwashed by Haruna, a woman from Yosho's past, and made to live with her as her lover. The fact that this is rape is ignored by the story — so that she can later tell Ayeka and Ryoko that they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> from her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrincessLucia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrincessLucia">Princess Lucia</a></em> repeatedly tries to rape Kouta due to the fact that if she has a child with him he will be able to destroy the world. Lucia is a devil.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">Evangeline</a> tells <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl">Chachamaru</a> "You can just force yourself on him.

</li><li> In the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Maburaho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Maburaho">Maburaho</a></em>, Kuriko attempts to get into Kazuki's pants for his genes- <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithATestTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithATestTube">genes that can give birth to a powerful magician</a>. Kazuki tries to fight her off and shouts that he would scream for help if she doesn't stop.

<ul><li> Dick Grayson, the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Robin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Robin">Robin</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Nightwing</a> and now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> seems especially prone to this:
<ul><li> In an issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>, Mirage shape shifts into the form of Starfire and sleeps with Nightwing, who doesn't realize she isn't his girlfriend until after the fact. This is used as a device to put stress on his relationship with Starfire, but the team largely under-reacts to Mirage's actions, and even mock him after they learn about it.
</li><li> <em>Nightwing</em> issues 93-100 are often accused of this due to the fact that Tarantula and Nightwing appear to run away together after Tarantula rapes Nightwing. These issues were actually meant to depict Nightwing as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">too deeply traumatized to assert himself</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Tarantula</a> bullies him from motel room to motel room, not minding that her "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousSpanish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousSpanish">querido</a>" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">nearly catatonic</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In a rather infamous example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a> was raped by the assassin Shado while badly injured and under medication. Other writers treated this as an affair, which resulted in Arrow—who was steadfastly loyal to Black Canary at the time of the incident—gaining a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">reputation</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">sleeping around constantly</a> behind the back of the long-suffering Canary. And Shado? Nobody so much as bats an eyelash at her actions. When she was discussing marrying him with Oracle, Oracle brought up Shado, and she angrily rejects the notion that he was to blame.
</li><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC</a> example: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Bruce Wayne</a>, upon finding out from Talia al Ghul that they have a son, notes to her that she drugged him during a ceremony wherein Ra's himself united Batman with Talia, during a short period where Bats and the Demon's Head had to work together. Bruce was fairly lucid when he slept with her (in <em>Batman: Son of the Demon</em>) and doesn't use the word "rape" or even "assault", but it's clear he didn't find it amusing after the fact but still takes the son (Damian Wayne) who is now the fifth Robin. Of course, this example is derived from the work of one writer (Mike W. Barr) being added upon by another (Grant Morrison), with a 19 year gap.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC</a> also had a case of reverse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeShesLikeInAComa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeShesLikeInAComa">Dude, She's Like, in a Coma!</a> between two of the founding members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a>. Saturn Girl tried to use her telepathic powers to bring Cosmic Boy out of a coma. It appeared that she'd succeeded, but instead she was subconsciously animating and controlling his comatose body; during this period they began dating, and Cos woke up at their wedding. This admittedly was not treated as "okay" so much as it was forgiven because Saturn Girl did it <em>subconsciously</em>, not on purpose.
</li><li> Horatio from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nexus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nexus">Nexus</a></em> was also drugged and raped, which resulted in the birth of his twin daughters. He later moved in with the girls and their rapist mother.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Fables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Fables">Fables</a></em> when Snow White and Bigby are both enchanted and wake up in a tent in the woods, discovering later that they slept together. While it's uncertain if it's rape (as both of them were under a spell and couldn't remember the action), Bigby is rather offended that Snow blames him and points out that for all they know, <em>she</em> seduced him.
</li><li> Foggy Nelson, the law partner and friend of Matt Murdock, AKA <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a>, was drugged and raped by a client of theirs named Lydia Mckenzie, who was secretly working for Mysterio. She then committed suicide by jumping out the window and made it appear that Nelson had pushed her. As a result, Foggy's girlfriend, Liz Allen (the original love interest of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> and widow of Green Goblin Harry Osborn), leaves him for cheating on her. He was also fired from his job because of the negative publicity it might bring the firm by his new law partner who is also his, until recently, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">Missing Mom</a>.
</li><li> In an issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thunderbolts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thunderbolts">Thunderbolts</a></em>, sex maniac Skein rapes SHIELD Super Agent Silicon, and it's played entirely for comedy.
</li><li> A really horrific Marvel example: In <em>Avengers West Coast</em> #56, Wanda, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScarletWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScarletWitch">Scarlet Witch</a>, had Agatha Harkness, USAgent, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWasp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWasp">The Wasp</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderMan">Wonder Man</a> under a spell that kept them immobilized. Wanda, who was suffering a mental breakdown at the time, ripped the shirt off of Wonder Man and forced herself on him while he screamed "No! NO!!!" Later, US Agent asked Wanda "How could you hurt him like that?" and Wasp asked "Simon (Wonder Man)...are you...? To which the clearly traumatised Wonder Man replied "Don't ask, Janet. Just don't ask!" Not only was the rape never mentioned again, but Wonder Man and Scarlet Witch briefly dated.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TarotWitchOfTheBlackRose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TarotWitchOfTheBlackRose">Tarot: Witch of the Black Rose</a></em>: Jon is raped and otherwise molested on a regular basis.... it's played for laughs.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSavageDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSavageDragon">The Savage Dragon</a></em>, the main character wakes up one night to find a female character named Horridus having oral sex with him. Horridus was a young lizard woman who had severe social problems and had decided to become Dragon's girlfriend. The scene is played for laughs.
</li><li> Captain Britain has been raped by female villains at least three times. None of the encounters were treated as "okay", but they are brushed off as more an occupational hazard than a violation, and were never brought up much afterward:
<ul><li> Once, in his own series, he's captured by an elderly female crime lord who called herself Vixen and is next seen suspended naked in a device clearly intended to facilitate her using him for sex. It's dismissed it as a dishonorable way to treat a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>, but no mainstream comic would dare depict a female heroine in a similar state back in the heyday of the Comics Code Authority (they might dare today, but it would be treated as a major, possibly life-altering trauma, and the writers would be roundly castigated as crossing a line in a cheap attempt to be edgy).
</li><li> In his own series again, when his inter-dimensional counterpart Kaptain Briton switched places with Brian and he ended up in villainess Sat-Yr-9's chamber, Sat-Yr-9 gave him a sedative to knock him out, after which he awoke naked and in bed with her gone. The scene is juxtaposed with Kaptain Briton's extremely nightmarish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape">Attempted Rape</a> of his AU-sister, Betsy (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">Psylocke</a>), who was forced to kill him thinking she was being assaulted by her own brother, played as deadly serious and traumatic as one would expect.
</li><li> The other time was an issue of <em>Excalibur</em> - the team is captured by Sat-Yr-9, who hands all of them over to another villain except for Cap, whom she keeps as a mind-controlled sex slave. She makes him walk around in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoGoEnslavement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoGoEnslavement">Chippendale's dancer-inspired</a> version of what her henchmen wear, and he's seen passed out naked in her bed. It's treated as significantly less severe a fate than whatever was happening to the other members of the team, and the possibility that it could have any greater psychological effect on Brian than any other random defeat by a villain isn't even paid lip service.
</li></ul></li><li> Once, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a></em> tried to convert the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a> villain Typhoid Mary to be good. At one point, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick">she disguised herself as Siryn</a>, whom he loved back then, and slept with him, only to reveal herself afterwards and mock his gullibility. Deadpool was distraught after the ordeal and Mary is presented as a villain, but the incident is rarely mentioned as rape, and whenever Typhoid Mary and Deadpool's relationship is referred to, it's referred to as consensual.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Catwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Catwoman">Catwoman</a> #1</em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">of the 2011 DC Relaunch</a>) featured an example of this, given that during Catwoman and Batman's encounter he seems very reluctant at first. In the words of Linkara, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotIfTheyEnjoyedItRationalization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotIfTheyEnjoyedItRationalization">Because it's not rape if he consents eventually</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">right</a>?"
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> comics, the infamous Cyclops/Emma Frost affair essentially started as this. Long story short: Cyke wasn't mentally in the best of health, Emma offered him therapy, then she uses this as an excuse to telepathically bang him. Seriously. Now flip their genders; what would happen to a male therapist if they convinced their female patient to have sex with them to deal with their issues? What makes this example even worse, Emma is treated like the victim and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticSue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticSue">Romantic Sue</a> in the resulting love triangle with all her seriously out-of-order behavior being ignored because 'she was in love with him', and <em>Cyclops</em> is <em>still</em> getting crap, in-universe and out, for cheating on his wife. It might not help that he got together with Emma immediately after his wife's death, but that was literally because Jean made him get together with her to avoid the X-Men falling apart.

Bizarrely, all the characters, including Harry himself, blame Harry for this and the author attempts to garner sympathy for Daphne, the rapist, even though she had violated Harry in order to curry favour with Voldemort.

She promptly admonishes them for making fun of the incident, as no one would be laughing if a woman were attacked and left somewhere naked.

She literally ties him up while he's asleep and when he wakes up tapes his mouth shut to stop his protests, and the next day he calls it a "midnight rape". Yet he falls in love with her and marries her by the end of the movie, and this is a comedy. They would never, never dare film this with the genders reversed.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em> film, there's an implied rape as a character is given a sleeping pill disguised as an assisted-suicide drug, and a female character has sex with him—albeit to prevent him from committing suicide for real. In any case, it's played for dark humor.
</li><li> It doesn't actually happen, but there are hints of it in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MoulinRouge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MoulinRouge">Moulin Rouge!</a></em>.

</li><li> Done painfully straight in the "comedy" <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Norbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Norbit">Norbit</a></em>, where Norbit is constantly physically, emotionally, and sexually assaulted by the over-sized "female" lead, due to him being trapped in a relationship with this woman merely because he is too weak willed to stand up for himself. If the genders were reversed, this wouldn't be the least bit funny.
</li><li> This trope is carried out in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood">Clint Eastwood</a> film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRookie1990" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRookie1990">The Rookie (1990)</a></em> as a punishment to the tied up relentless tough cop by his captor woman. His sole reaction was insisting "she did not sit on my face" after his partner ridiculed him about it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FortyDaysAndFortyNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FortyDaysAndFortyNights">40 Days and 40 Nights</a></em> the protagonist vows not to have sex or masturbate during Lent. During said period, he meets and falls in love with a girl. Just to be sure, he spends the last night of Lent chained to his bed, falls asleep <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and awakens being raped by his EX-girlfriend. His girlfriend walks in and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SincerityMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SincerityMode">quite naturally</a> assumes he's being lying to her the whole time. To top it off he later has to <em>apologize</em> to his girlfriend for this, and the ex both wins a bet and gets off scot-free. The protagonist's best friend even says, "This doesn't seem like one of those 'truth shall set you free' situations", when, actually, it seems like precisely that type of situation</span>. <a class="urllink" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/3psi5q/i_am_rob_perez_i_wrote_40_days_40_nights_among/cw91kqo/">When asked, the writer defended it, and mocked someone who tried to talk about male rape<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

Things go drastically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape">hilariously</a>, sadomasochistically wrong for him. The audience doesn't really have much sympathy for him, even as he cries out, "Help, this crazy tomato is raping me!" Definitely a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a>, but, presumably, would have been less acceptable had the genders been reversed.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCarrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCarrey">Jim Carrey</a> film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YesMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YesMan">Yes-Man</a></em>, the protagonist promises to say yes to everything. He is propositioned by an old woman who lives in his building, and when he tries to say no, he is karmically punished. Think for a second about how this would be treated if the protagonist was a woman.
</li><li> This trope is played for laughs in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HamburgerTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HamburgerTheMovie">Hamburger The Movie</a></em>. A woman pulls a machine gun on the main character while wearing nothing but a pair of panties. She forces him on the bed and demands to have sex with him. He gets out of the situation by pretending to be a homosexual, making her leave. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment">Oddly enough, neither character mentions this throughout the rest of the film</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Disclosure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Disclosure">Disclosure</a></em> with Michael Douglas and Demi Moore is a detailed examination of this trope. It's a film based on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCrichton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCrichton">Michael Crichton</a> book about a man sexually harassed by his female boss, and the MAJOR uphill battle he has to perform to convince everyone that he wasn't the aggressor.
</li><li> Played for laughs in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrAlien">Dr Alien</a></em>. A teenage boy is implanted (without his knowledge, initially) with an alien organ meant to stimulate females with sonics, resulting in him getting assaulted by a girl he was taking to a movie, the girlfriend of a bully, and a locker room full of women (and their coach).

After he protests vocally against sexual entanglements of sorts with the woman, she ignores it and does so anyway. It's especially bad in that afterwards, he staggers back to Aldous Snow, played by Russell Brand, clearly traumatised and terrified, stammers out "I think I've just been raped", and Aldous gives him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GargleBlaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GargleBlaster">Jeffery</a> and tells him he'll be fine in a minute. It's in character for the totally emotionally numb Aldous, but the movie itself seems to care about as much as he does.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Swordfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Swordfish">Swordfish</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Gabriel</a> force <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHacking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHacking">Hollywood Hacker</a> Stan at gunpoint to comply with the parameters of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a>: as a female escort gives him the oral part of the exam, he has to hack into the DoD mainframe in 60 seconds or die.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersRevengeOfTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersRevengeOfTheFallen">Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</a></em> has a Decepticon disguised as a human female track down Sam in college, force him to the bed, and into a very compromising position. When Sam's girlfriend finds them, she is furious at him, and the situation is played for laughs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlmostFamous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlmostFamous">Almost Famous</a></em> has a scene where a flock of 18-to-20-year-old girls have sex with a 15-year-old boy, shouting "deflower the kid!" Consider how that would be treated if the genders were reversed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PeeWeesBigAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PeeWeesBigAdventure">Pee-wee's Big Adventure</a></em> - as an angry biker gang discuss what they're going to do with Pee-Wee before they kill him, a big Amazon biker babe grabs him by the lapel and growls "<em>I</em> say you let <em>me</em> have him first!" - the other bikers find this hilarious.
</li><li> A lesser sexual offense than rape, but same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a>: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnAmericanWerewolfInLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnAmericanWerewolfInLondon">An American Werewolf in London</a></em>, another nurse remarks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> that she'd "had a look" at the unconscious David's genitals. If a male nurse had admitted to peeking under female patients' gowns, he'd get canned on the spot, but in this case the voyeuse is merely chided that it's improper behavior.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HorribleBosses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HorribleBosses">Horrible Bosses</a></em> doesn't so much play this straight as avert it while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice">playing it for laughs anyways</a>. Dentist Julia (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferAniston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferAniston">Jennifer Aniston</a>) drugs Dale her assistant and molests him while he's unconscious. She later shows him photos she took of this that look like them having sex and threatens to show them to his fiance if he does not have sex with her. Dale is very upset and angry by this and calls it rape and Julia is portrayed as a horrible person though it is still played for comedy more than rape usually is when the victim is female.
</li><li> Played straight in the 1949 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NeptunesDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NeptunesDaughter">Neptune's Daughter</a></em>. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYqKEAehPU">Betty Garrett sings ''Baby It's Cold Outside'' to Red Skelton<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> while fondling and groping him as he tries to get her out of his apartment. It's an over the top parody of an earlier scene with Ricardo Montalbán and Esther Williams, with the roles being reversed.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tabloid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tabloid">Tabloid</a></em> tells the true story of a beautiful woman who kidnapped a homely male missionary, tied him to a bed, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRashomon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRashomon">allegedly</a> raped him for several days. The whole thing is mostly told from her perspective and played for laughs. It's hard to imagine that a movie about a homely man kidnapping and raping a beautiful young nun for several days would be quite as lighthearted.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pleasantville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pleasantville">Pleasantville</a></em>, Jennifer goes on a date with the town jock, who she quickly manipulates into having sex with her. This is Played for Laughs, though at the time, the boy had no idea what sex was (or for that matter, STD's or even pregnancy), was visibly freaked out, and even mistook his erection for an "illness." Had the sexes been reversed, the boy would have been villified.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Super" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Super">Super</a></em>, wherein Ellen Page's ingénue, superhero-horny character overpowers Rainn Wilson's character and forcibly has sex with him. He fights her and angrily throws her off, but subsequently acts as if it never happened, and they continue to fight crime together.
</li><li> Towards the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SexAndDeath101" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SexAndDeath101">Sex and Death 101</a></em>, the protagonist <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">learns that the last name on the list of all the women he has and ever will sleep with is that of an infamous misandrist vigilante who drugs men into permanent comas and not wishing to be a victim</span> attempts not to have sex for a while, and is trying to burn off the excess energy through bicycling. He ends up having an accident, and while he's lying injured, a busload of Catholic Schoolgirls find him and decide to lose their virginity to him. This is followed up by the bus driver also deciding to get a piece <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and her plus the schoolgirls equal all the names before the aforementioned vigilante</span>. This is all played for laughs.
</li><li> In the film <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spring1941" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spring1941">Spring 1941</a></em>, a Jewish family, the Plancks, is hiding from the Nazis in the attic of a Polish farmer, Emilia. Emilia falls in love with Artur Planck (who can pass for a gentile and thus spends his days helping her with her farmwork), and pursues him, although he's married and obviously devoted to his wife and daughter. Artur begins sleeping with her, while Emilia starts restricting the number of times a day he can go up to see his family, eventually bringing the number down to once a week. She makes it plain that she will kick them out if he gives her reason to be jealous. Artur is not happy with any of this. His wife views it as cheating, which is justified given both the time period and the character's overall emotional state, but the film itself seems to treat the whole situation as a love triangle rather than repeated rape via blackmail.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StepBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StepBrothers">Step Brothers</a></em>, Dale's stepsister-in-law Alice falls <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouCrazy">madly in love</a> with him after he gives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">her abusive asshole husband</a> what for. How does she show her appreciation? By cornering him in the men's room, undoing his pants without even waiting for an answer, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourCheatingHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourCheatingHeart">having her way with him</a> via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeedSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeedSex">rapid</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodPeopleHaveGoodSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodPeopleHaveGoodSex">but satisfying</a> sex <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallBangHer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallBangHer">with him up against the wall</a>. How does he respond after it's said and done? He says he likes her and thinks she's incredible. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnratedEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnratedEdition">Unrated Edition</a>, they have another quickie during Christmas dinner - but it seems more mutually consensual.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder5');">    Literature </div><div class="folder" id="folder5" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The version with the character waking up with the wrong woman sort of happens in one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman">Flashman</a></em> books, because the villain uses this trope to coerce the title character into doing his bidding; by having the woman cry rape and having the authority to get Flashman off.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FangsOfKaath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FangsOfKaath">Fangs Of Kaath</a></em>, characters of both genders are vilified both by the narrative and the heroes when they rape females. However, Fatima's attempt to rape Raschid <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0gt8l');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0gt8l" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0gt8l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(which involves sneaking into his bed, groping him, forcefully kissing him even after repeated refusals on Raschid's part, and <em>throwing a vase at the wall when he refuses</em>)</span> is considered, in-universe, a minor annoyance. At the end, Raschid asks her to stay in the palace and "remain [his] friend", even giving her a lavish promotion! Fatima feels guilty for all of two pages, and then she is totally forgiven and gets her happy ending. Compare this to the rapists Maru and Abbas, who are hated by everyone and unambiguously portrayed as villains.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWorldAccordingToGarp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWorldAccordingToGarp">The World According to Garp</a>,</em> the title character is conceived when his mother, Jenny, rapes a wounded, dying man in her care—an act made creepier because the man was mentally devolving into an infantile state and seemed to regard Jenny as a mother figure. While male-on-female rape is a constant theme in the remainder of the book, Jenny's female-on-male rape is presented (by the other characters, if not necessarily the author) as a revolutionary act, and is never referred to as rape. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook">The Film of the Book</a>, however, someone calls it out as rape.
</li><li> Forms the primary plot motivator in the novel and later film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Disclosure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Disclosure">Disclosure</a></em>. An employee eventually storms away from his former lover and current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist">Straw Feminist</a> boss after she starts giving him fellatio. As revenge, she sues *him* for sexual harassment and the inherent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> of this trope is what really vexes the male main character. Fortunately, the employee, with anonymous email tips, manages to find a sexual harassment attorney who specializes in dealing with men as victims. With her help and a helpful audio recording where the employee is heard refusing the woman's advances at least fifty times, he is fully vindicated. It's only after he finds out that the <em>company president</em> has succumbed to the woman's wiles that things get worse for him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em> books, Mat encounters the widowed Queen of Ebou Dar, a nation in which men are second-class citizens. Mat is repeatedly raped by the Queen, frequently tied down at knife-point and forced to be her sexual servant against his will. This is all treated as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape">comedy</a> because Mat is normally a consumate flirt. The fact that he is sexually victimized is treated as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">his come-uppance</a> for his previous behavior. When finally freed of the Queen's subjugation, he reflects that he will miss her. If the sexes were reversed, this would be seen as a creepy example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome">Stockholm Syndrome</a>, but due to the prevailing theme of dominant, aggressive women in the series, it's more likely a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">Author Appeal</a>.
</li><li> In the book <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ConradsTimeMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ConradsTimeMachine">Conrad's Time Machine</a></em>, the main character is raped by three women; he says he doesn't think they should be prosecuted like male rapists should, and in fact we later discover this was part of his bachelor party that his best friend set up for him.
</li><li> In Peter David's <em>The Woad to Wuin</em> (sequel to <em>Sir Apropos of Nothing</em>), the first chapter is a parody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> in which the eponymous character finds "the One Thing to Rule Them All", an artifact which makes him irresistible to women (as well as perpetually virile), including his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">antagonist love interest</a>. He spends quite a few days tied down in an inn being raped by women before being rescued by a mock-Fellowship, and going off (unwillingly) to rid himself of the Thing. When he finally succeeds and returns, he of course is blamed for "forcing" himself on the woman, and she storms off.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YouRangMLord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YouRangMLord">You Rang, M'Lord?</a></em> Teddy hits on a plan to get out of marrying a woman he doesn't love: when she's spending the night at his house he'll creep into her bedroom and then do nothing. She'll assume he's impotent and call the wedding off. He doesn't count on how enthusiastically she'll react to finding him getting into bed with her, and although the character is quite unhappy about what's happened, it's played for laughs.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> novel <em>Last Human</em>, Lister is forced to marry a hideously ugly Gelf (Genetically Engineered Life Form). The situation is played mostly for laughs, but his emotions during the sex are touched on in a curiously realistic way:
<div class="indent">Oh, my God, he was close to climax. She really knew what she was doing. Oh, he was so disgusted. Did he have no self-control? She was descended from hippos, for God's sake.
</div></li><li> A similar scenario occurs in the TV series Episode "Polymorph II", though in this case Lister manages to escape before his "wife" can get his clothes off.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> books there are several mentions of love potions. All of them have a girl slipping a boy the potion, and in most cases it's played for laughs. Note that love potions make the drinker temporarily obsessed with whoever gave them the potion, so they can be compared to date rape drugs. Fred and George's shop have an entire display of them with a special owl order service that disguises them as cough potions to get them past the Aurors screening all the mail coming into Hogwarts.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></em> one of Harry's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanGirl">fangirls</a> accidentally gives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Ron</a> a love potion. Harry and Hermione are worried by the situation, but their main concern is that the potion was expired and Ron's reaction was outside normal parameters; the scene is still treated as comical.
</li><li> And then deconstructed when Dumbledore says <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Merope Gaunt's use of love potions to elope with Tom Riddle was no different than using the Imperius Curse (an illegal mind-control spell) since Merope kept Tom Riddle drugged for <em>months</em>, forcing him to leave his family and live with her against his will, which is a bit worse than snogging someone who wouldn't have snogged you under normal circumstances</span>. It's possible the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> is supposed to be in-universe, and the Merope thing is to highlight what the reader thought was harmless. And <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Voldemort</span> actually <em>admires</em> his mother for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">drugging and raping his father and detesting him for naturally getting the fuck out when the potion she used wore off</span>. This is mentioned by Dumbledore as another sign of his utter insanity.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight in Ken Follett's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorldWithoutEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorldWithoutEnd">World Without End</a></em>. Merthin is raped by Griselda, the daughter of the man of whom he is an apprentice. It turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it was all a plot by Elfric so he would not have to give Merthin a free set of tools and a full guild membership, however.</span>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a></em> does this with Dathomir. Luke even moralizes about everything wrong with this trope. Then later Luke and Ben go back to Dathomir, and Ben asks "What kind of woman could I find here anyway?"

She thinks it's this trope, and in fact some recompense for his fighting ability winning him more respect from the Astartes than she gets.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FallenAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FallenAngels">Fallen Angels</a></em> (by Niven/Pournelle/Flynn), Captain Lee Arteria (female) announces that she will be taking Bob Needleton's seed with her when she leaves. They've only just met, and when he hesitates, she explicitly says: "I didn't ask." There are several other people watching, and only one person asks "Shouldn't we be trying to rescue him?" However, he doesn't bear a grudge.

James Macdonald, a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">spy, Iulan Vai</span> takes advantage of a convalescing Arekhon's semi-consciousness to have sex with him even though his semi-conscious state means he cannot truly consent. Arekhon believes she is his lover, Elaeli. Even more creepy—this act becomes the start of a relationship.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiftwarCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiftwarCycle">The Riftwar Cycle</a></em> series, while on the Dasati homeworld, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">rebel leader Naureen, who's sheltering hero Pug and co, conscripts Pug's son Magnus as her boy toy.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AbsolutePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AbsolutePower">Absolute Power</a></em> by David Baldacci, the President is having an affair with the wife of a wealth supporter. Unfortunately, he is abusive, and his lover attacks him with a letter opener, causing the Secret Service to shoot her dead. His chief of staff goes into full spin mode, and has them leave her with the President, who's passed out on the bed from the shock. She then <em>has sex with him while he's unconscious</em>. Why? Because she has a thing for him, and feels sorry the unfortunate fact that the Secret Service had to kill his lover kept him from getting laid. "Technically, she had committed rape. Realistically she was confident she had fulfilled many a male's dream," the character rationalizes. Yeah...more than just "technically" rape. Things go downhill from there...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeartInHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeartInHand">Heart In Hand</a></em>, The protagonist Darryl mentions to his friend Ethan that he "isn't sure" about whether his first time sleeping with a girl (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">actually his male love interest</span>) was consensual. Ethan immediately assumes that Darryl raped her and remains suspicious even after Darryl clarifies that the consent was dubious on his part because he was under the influence of alcohol.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Marked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Marked">Marked</a></em>, Zoey accidentally comes upon Erik and Aphrodite in the hallway. Erik is very uncomfortable and repeatedly says he does not want Aphrodite to give him a blow job, while Aphrodite insists that he does in fact want her and then slashes his thigh and drinks from it—a very sexual act for vampires. However, not once is this ever even thought of as sexual assault—Zoey's problem with Aphrodite isn't that she's ignoring Erik's wishes, it's that giving blowjobs is "skanky" and "letting a guy use you".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMahabharata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMahabharata">The Mahabharata</a></em>, Ulupi drags Arjuna underwater and propositions him, threatening to commit suicide after his initial refusal. Even though she's a total stranger, Arjuna considers this romantic and sexy. Compare this to the scene where Durodhyana threatens to rape Draupadi, a show of cruelty so enraging that several other Kshatriya (including Krishna, who is <em>literally</em> virtue incarnate) declare war on him.

<ul><li> Played for laughs, at least to some degree, in the episode "First Contact". Disguised as an alien, Commander Riker is trying to escape when a female alien confronts him. She agrees to help him, but only if he has sex with her first. It is hard to imagine Troi agreeing to have sex with a male alien to escape. Which is made even worse when you consider that he was seriously injured at the time.

After trying to let her down easy, she becomes more aggressive and forces him onto the ground.

Picard cracks a joke about how what just went down could be considered a crime, but otherwise seems none the worse for wear.

At least one crewmember, Lt. Kelby has sex with one of the women while under the influence of her pheromones. It is implied that Archer also does. Whilst the Orions' actions are treated as wrong, there seems to be no indication that anyone notices that they raped two people. Similarly, in the season 3 episode 'Rajiin' a woman mind rapes Archer (along with T'Pol and Hoshi.) The scenes are clearly set up to resemble a sexual attack, but again no one really acknowledges the implications.

</li><li> Faith: having sex with Riley while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">she was in Buffy's body</a>. Curiously, the show focused much more on how Buffy was upset about this and had trouble trusting Riley afterwards, and very little regarding Riley's reaction.
</li><li> Another example: Buffy, while invisible, throws Spike against the wall and strips him before he figures out who she is and she performs oral sex on him after he tells her to leave. We cut away before we can really figure it out. Note that, later that same season, Spike attempts to violently rape Buffy and is treated as a complete monster for it. Of course, this <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasochismTango" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasochismTango">Spike and Buffy</a> we're talking about...

<ul><li> Not rape, but sexual harassment: Joey is offered a role in a soap opera— in exchange for sleeping with the female casting director. In the end he refuses, only for her to offer him a bigger role on the same terms, and he does end up sleeping with her. The entire scenario is played for laughs, as the other five place bets on whether or not he would do it, and his only qualms about the situation are about his pride being hurt that he wouldn't have truly "earned" the role. Never once does it come up that <em>it's completely illegal and morally reprehensible</em> for employers to solicit sex from employees (or potential employees) as a criterion for hiring or promotion.
</li><li> There is another example when Phoebe starts a relationship with Ursula's (her identical twin sister) ex-boyfriend, Eric. Phoebe shows up at Eric's house, expecting to "pick up where they'd left off" earlier in the episode, only to have Eric mention how he's still quite tired from the sex they had earlier in the day. Only, Phoebe and Eric never slept together, and they soon realise that Ursula had come over, and believing she was Phoebe, Eric slept with her. If this had been twin brothers and a girlfriend, it would have turned into a completely different sort of show all together.

Though Bree does call it rape, it's mostly played straight/for laughs (no trauma, no shock, no nothing). One can only imagine the internet backdraft if Orson was the rapist. At the very least when Bree finds out she is so disgusted and furious that she punches the bitch to the floor on the spot.

When the all-female task force find him afterwards, he is catatonic and surrounded by obvious signs of a struggle. At the end of the episode, when he admits that a lot of the larval DNA is going to be his, Jack O'Neill reacts in disgust. It never comes up again until Hathor's next (and last) appearance, which amounts solely to Daniel refusing to look at her and saying that he "tries not to" think about their last encounter.
</li><li> In the episode "Brief Candle", Jack is drugged by the woman who proceeds to 'have sex' with him. No one—not the characters, not even the writers—seem to realize that this is rape, and Jack and this woman then proceed to develop a true friendship not based on sex. Or something.

After they argue a bit about who's in charge, she simply takes over his body. Later she wrests control from him to force him to kiss his girlfriend (which he'd been too shy to do), and then to kiss Dr. Beckett against the man's will. She did all this without ever asking McKay's permission, and while ignoring his protests. It's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape">comedy episode</a> and we're supposed to side with the woman during all of this. There are no consequences for her, except starting a brief relationship with Dr. Beckett, which he later ends offscreen, because he can't stop remembering that first kiss she planted on him while using McKay's body, which may have been a lame attempt of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">Author's Saving Throw</a>.
</li><li> Jim Profit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Profit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Profit">Profit</a></em> was sexually abused by his stepmother, who blackmails him back into the sexual relationship upon discovering that he has become wealthy and powerful. Despite the fact that he is clearly unhappy whenever he's forced to engage in this behavior, and her repeated demands that he allow her to tie him up and beat him bloody, the writers and some of the fans seem to view it as a kinky relationship, not a series of sexual assaults. Fans often excuse the relationship because Jim is so wicked, ignoring that his stepmother is actually one of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuses</a> for being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero">Sociopathic Hero</a> and that if their genders were reversed she'd be one of the most vilified characters of all time.

He wakes up knowing that it happened, but not who the girl was. When he tries to talk to the school nurse about it she assumes it was male on male, when he tells her it was a girl or possibly multiple girls she just laughs at him and tell him that female on male is physically impossible. As for the protagonist, she treats it as a regular one-night-stand, but eventually comes to realize that the guy feels differently, and apologizes.
</li><li> Addressed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Misfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Misfits">Misfits</a></em>: Alisha has the ability to overwhelm people with lust just by touching them; once she got over the initial shock, she begins using it to draw in sexual partners. Apparently, she doesn't consider anything wrong with this—up until she tries it out on Curtis, who knows about her power; he reacts with disgust and anger (not shying away from calling the experience rape in later episodes). Intially petulant, claiming that Curtis is "the one with the problem", Alisha begins to lose confidence when she realises that her supposed "boyfriends" can't even remember what happened; eventually, she gives up on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPerversionPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPerversionPotential">Power Perversion Potential</a> once and for all when she almost ends up getting raped while using her power.

It turned out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerChildStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerChildStar">Former Child Star</a> was having his wife pick up gay and bisexual women for him to rape while she watched, and afterwards she could not stand that they had been with him so she shot them in the vagina. After he found out that she had murdered them (he thought she was just dropping them off back at their homes), he offered to make it up to her by having them abduct a man for her to rape and him to kill. The man they abducted was the bartender who had been hitting on the main character for the entire show and once had an affair with the wife. He is tied up and raped by the wife but before they have a chance to shoot him the FBI arrived and the evil couple decides to use him as a hostage. They then trade him for the leader of the FBI team and the husband is shot by the wife when he said the murders were all her idea. The bartender showed up again in the next episode, hitting on the main character, no worse for wear and even joking about the experience. The episode after that begins with the two of them in bed together.
</li><li> Played for laughs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Eastwick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Eastwick">Eastwick</a></em>, where Joanna has the power to make men do what she wants. In one episode she used it to prove to her love interest that she wasn't interested in him by flirting with a guy at a party. When the guy started to back off from her, she used her mindpowers to get him to have sex with her. And then we find out that not only is the guy she slept with gay, he's in a committed relationship. It's made 100% clear that the guy would never have slept voluntarily with Joanna, and yet it's played as another 'oh, that silly Joanna, she has such bad luck with men!' moment and she's the one who feels embarrassed and humiliated.
</li><li> Happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse">Dollhouse</a></em> once. Senator Daniel Perrin is drugged and then implied to have been raped by Echo's current imprint for a video that would ruin his reputation. He suffers no emotional trauma, he just wants her as evidence for the existence of the Dollhouse. Of course, since he's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">also a doll and has been programmed to only think about bringing down the Dollhouse</span>, this ends up making sense.

At the very least she gets into bed with him and lets him think that sex took place. The woman in question is almost always condemned for her actions, but rarely is she ever referred to as a rapist, when if the genders were reversed, no one would hesitate to apply this term to a man.
</li><li> An especially twisty version on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungAndTheRestless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungAndTheRestless">The Young and the Restless</a></em>. Not only does the drunken man make advances to his wife's friend on his own, rather than her seducing him (it was dark and his inebriation plus their resemblance led him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick">genuinely mistake her for his wife</a>), when he realizes his mistake and confronts the woman, asking why she didn't tell him who she really was, she claims that <em>he's</em> the one who forced himself on her and that she didn't protest because she was too frightened to do anything.
</li><li> On a second season episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em>, called "Overload" Nick revealed to Catherine that he was raped by a last minute replacement baby sitter when he was 9 years old. While it was obviously a traumatic experience he has not made any references to it since then, presumably because of this trope, not even in the tenth season episode "Death and the Maiden" when he is deeply affected by the case of a young teen who was sexually assaulted (albeit by a man). When Nick goes to a rape counselor for the boy, she accused him of not really caring about the victims and said that most male victims would not admit being raped. Instead of proving her wrong on both accounts, he simply said that she did not care about him because he had a badge and left.

She does promptly come back to her senses, though.

She ignores him when he tells her to stop, and he appears to be distressed; but later in the same episode is still living with her and while he is briefly upset, seems to get over it as soon as she tells him she has feelings for him. The incident isn't mentioned again.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EngineSentaiGoOnger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EngineSentaiGoOnger">Engine Sentai Go-onger</a> </em>, when the team first meets the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic">Stripperiffic</a> villainess Kegareshia, she responds to Hanto by lashing him with her whip, standing on his back and then taunting him with seductive "baby talk." He is visibly scared and upset but is able to throw her off him. It's played for laughs and possibly mild <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> but had it been a male villain and Saki, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple">the only girl on the team</a>, it would have come across as creepy and at least an implied threat of rape.
</li><li> An even worse example occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NinjaSentaiKakuranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NinjaSentaiKakuranger">Ninja Sentai Kakuranger</a></em> where a female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> has her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> tear Saizou's clothes off while she takes a photo of him. Also played for laughs even though he's actually crying and shaking.
</li><li> <em>Sunao ni Narenakute</em> has "Linda's" boss blackmailing him into sex. He is devastated at this, mostly because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's in love with Nakaji</span> but the show does imply that what the boss does is made worse because she's overweight, ugly and middle-aged, as if having an attractive woman force herself on you is somehow less wrong.

He is beaten over several days and then handcuffed to a bed, gagged and raped more then once. When he is finally rescued, everyone says that the situation was simply him cheating on his wife. In fact, when the writers were asked about it, they outright stated that men cannot get raped. They eventually refused to acknowledge the plot entirely, despite the amount of controversy it brought. However, a few years later Jax's stepson Michael was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonRape">raped as well</a>. Another plot line the writers, so far, have refused to acknowledge.

No one treats this as rape. A bad thing that he's working with her, but not rape. In fact, they criticize him for "acting like a jerk" after he's cured.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Degrassi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Degrassi">Degrassi</a></em>: <em>The Next Generation</em>: A male student meets an older woman through an online video game. He only wants to play the game, and is disturbed and repulsed when she attempts to make a move on him. Of course, it's noteworthy that said woman is rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">homely and unattractive</a>—of course any male teenager would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">out of his mind</a> to not want to be statutory-raped by a "hot" older woman.
</li><li> In an early episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a></em>, Carter is accidentally knocked out by a classmate. When he comes to, he's surprised to find himself in a hospital gown and in a bed. The nurse proceeds to gleefully tell him that since he was unconscious, since they were already checking him for injuries, and since the medical student was new and needed to practice performing a physical exam, she allowed her to perform a full exam on Carter, <em>including his genitalia and a rectal exam</em>, despite the fact that Carter was unconscious and therefore unable to give or deny consent. The entire scene is of course, played for laughs, despite the fact that Carter is genuinely freaked out and upset—though his main concern seems to be that his genitalia were classified as "average", rather than "normal", as Carter insists. When Carter asks if they're just joking with him, they respond by laughing even more and refusing to answer him, thus leaving the matter up in the air, leaving him even more freaked out and for the rest of the day, subjected to relentless teasing from his other colleagues. A male doctor pulling a similar stunt would have been arrested in two seconds, and even if he were merely joking and hadn't really done anything, he'd still likely face a severe reprimand.

Malik is a football player, and this would likely destroy his life completely, especially since he has done many questionable things already. Anyway, after they slept together (the show never acknowledges that this is rape, even with the look of despair on his face) she hits him in the back of the head and makes him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadedDoubleEntendre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadedDoubleEntendre">go another round</a>.

She becomes instantly infatuated with him, convinces herself that their marriage is real, and eventually blackmails him into sex—he is Iranian and could be executed for homosexuality if he is sent back to his own country. All of this is largely played for laughs, though with the obvious overtone that Hattie is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouCrazy">not in the best of mental health</a>.
</li><li> Examined in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGeorgeLopezShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGeorgeLopezShow">The George Lopez Show</a></em>. When George and Angie find out a sex offender is living in their neighborhood, George gathers a mob of neighbors to harass the person at their house. When it turns out to be a woman, everyone leaves. However, Angie still thinks the person is a threat. Later in the episode, Max ends up at the woman's house, and they all think she was trying to rape him, but it turns out <em>he</em> showed up at her house and wanted to have sex with her.
</li><li> One infamous episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TooCloseForComfort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TooCloseForComfort">Too Close for Comfort</a></em> has Monroe kidnapped and raped by two women. Oddly enough, only Mr. Rush sees Monroe as the victim of a crime while his wife and two daughters think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Monroe somehow "cooperated" with his rapists</a>.
</li><li> Pretty much the entire premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostGirl">Lost Girl</a></em>. The main character, a succubus, routinely uses her magical roofies to get what she wants (usually from men). It's stated outright that this is what she brings to her and Kenzi's PI business. She also spent years draining the life out of everyone she had sex with. In the penultimate episode of Season 1, Dyson, a wolf shifter, is attacked by the succubus Aife and forced to have sex with her just as the main character, his girlfriend Bo, also a succubus, walks in on them. He was not coerced with "magical succubus roofie" but simply overpowered by her and is definitely depicted as him struggling and unwilling. It is later referred to as a seduction by Bo and no one ever talks about the fact he was unwilling. Nor do they seem sympathetic to him when he returns after a 3 week absence, seemingly completely mystified why he would have taken off for so long. However, his character behaves like a man that has been violated, by putting himself in a similar situation of vulnerablity with the Norn, then later goes on a spree of getting into bar brawls up and down the East coast, and cuts himself off from Bo. (It's written however that all of his behavior is due to what the Norn did and not anything to do with his rape at the hands of Aife.)

Sisko finds the whole thing hilarious and suggests that it would do Odo good to take her up on the offer. <em>In the same episode</em> Sisko tells Dr Bashir about an incident a few years before when he punched a male ambassador in the face for making advances to a female member of his crew.

Harry Kim is "chosen" as a mate by a burly Klingon female who's significantly larger and stronger than him. Kim makes it clear he has no interest in a relationship, expresses extreme fear of the woman, and even winds up being stalked, but nobody seems to take the matter with any degree of seriousness. Things reach a particularly uncomfortable point when Harry goes to sick bay with bite-marks, indicating abuse, and is given a grossly inappropriate response the audience is meant to find amusing.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Harry:</strong> One of the Klingons attacked me. <br/><strong>Doctor:</strong> <em>(concerned)</em> Did you do something to provoke him? <br/><strong>Harry:</strong> Not him, her.

I've studied the section on Klingon mating rituals in the cultural database. <br/><strong>Harry:</strong> Then maybe you can tell me how to convince a female twice my size that I'm not interested? <br/><strong>Doctor:</strong> You probably can't. As I understand it, you have two options: kill her or mate with her.

It's zigzagged back and forth—Mal does want to sleep with Saffron, but refuses to do so until she convinces him that she's doing it because she wants to, and not because she believes he has the right to do so regardless of her consent. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And when it's revealed that she just did the whole thing for fun and screwed over and tried to kill Mal and his crew, he was disgusted.</span>

It's a little shaky on how it's portrayed; Bret is clearly traumatised afterwards and the woman is shown to be deeply unpleasant, but some of Bret's comments about the experience (such as how it only lasted a few minutes and she fell asleep right after) and Jermaine pretending to be him to another woman hoping for the same appear to be playing it partially for laughs.
</li><li> Adam and Yvonne in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK">Being Human (UK)</a></em>. Although Adam is actually a 47 year old vampire so no statutory rape actually occurred, Yvonne, a middle aged woman, entered into a sexual relationship with him believing he was a 14 year old. Yet she is portrayed sympathetically and their relationship as ultimately a good thing. There's also the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as a succubus, Yvonne brainwashes any man that she touches into being madly in love with her, regardless of how he would feel otherwise.

Frank is shown as being extremely uncomfortable throughout the whole scene and asks that "stop" be their safeword. When he sees her pull out a GIANT dildo, he sees "stop" immediately but it's implied that she anally penetrates him with the dildo anyways as he screams out "stop" again.

This causes him and Ian to break up and leaves Mickey trapped in a marriage with a woman he is not attracted to and despises. Nobody really treats this as rape however, and even Mickey's sister Mandy is angry with him when he refuses to go to the hospital to be with Svetlana when she gives birth, especially when he says it's not his fault she got pregnant in the first place. Svetlana is also furious that Mickey refuses to be a devoted husband and father, and that he resumes his relationship with Ian instead of focusing on her and the baby.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder8');">    Mythology and Religion </div><div class="folder" id="folder8" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Somewhat common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology">Greek Mythology</a> where the prevailing feeling seemed to be "rape is ok when it is the strong on the weak." Perhaps the best know example of this was The Amazons which as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flipped</a> version of a typical warrior race would regularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual">rape prisoners of both genders</a> just like their male counterparts. This was a major part of Greco-Roman culture. Any kind of sex was fine, including rape, as long as it involved domination of a social subordinate (usually a slave or wife; or in some cases, such as Spartan society, a younger male protege). To submit, sexually, to someone weaker or socially inferior was considered highly shameful, and grounds for anything from exploitative humour to outright ostracism.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ArthurianLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ArthurianLegend">Arthurian Legend</a>, Sir Galahad was conceived when his father, Sir Lancelot, was drugged and raped twice. While the person who drugged him (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp">Morgan Le Fay</a>) is typically seen as a villain, both the rapes' mastermind (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FisherKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FisherKing">Fisher King</a> who wanted the perfect grandson) and the rapist herself (Princess Elaine) were not shown to be bad people.
</li><li> When Asmodeus of <em>Tobit</em> stalks a woman and prevents her from consummating any marriages he is declared "The Worst Of Demons". Other Jewish mythology figures, the four demon queens Lilith, Naamah, Eisheth Zenunim and Agrat, want sex without care for consent but if they happen to rape an unwilling man, even if it takes more than one of them to subdue him, it is still his fault and any resulting abominations they may birth are the man's responsibility. Asmodeus may in fact be one of their sons. Thankfully the whole of this material is not canon to any modern religion.

<ul><li> While more along the lines of "double standard <em>statutory</em> rape: female on male," <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> features a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructiveParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructiveParody">Deconstructive Parody</a> of that particular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> in which 2-year old Ike's 25-year old female teacher had regular sex with him. Although the adult men in series are saying "nice" regarding Ike's sexual conquest in spite of Kyle's outraged outcry, the show itself presents this as sick. The kicker is that when Kyle first told the police that Ike was with an older person, they immediately went to the conclusion that Ike must have been raped by an older guy. When Kyle corrected them, all they had to say was "nice" and were only willing to arrest her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness">when they thought she was ugly</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Surprisingly subverted in an episode in which Lois rapes Peter. It's played out for comedic effect and other characters (save Brian) think Peter is totally pathetic for it, but he is notably disturbed by the whole thing.
</li><li> Then used in a later episode, where Lois more explicitly rapes Peter after he takes up abstinence, and is portrayed as being completely right in doing so. Earlier in the episode, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard">they made fun of Christian groups who advocate abstinence</a>, and Lois even goes "Abstinence is <em>wrong</em>! Just...wrong!" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0qokh');"><sup>Context </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0qokh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0qokh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Meg had gotten around the abstinence rule by having ear sex, in a parody of how some Christian youths consider anal and oral sex still "technically" maintaining their virginity.</span> Part of the satirization was the fallacious reasoning the group gave, including the one that convinced Peter, but it still uses this trope in a way that's rather tasteless
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Peter</strong>: I'm abstinent, Lois. It's all in these pamphlets Meg brought home from school. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">Sex turns straight people gay and turns gays into Mexicans</a>. Everyone goes down a notch.
</div><ul><li> And yet again in "Peter-assment", where Peter is being sexually harassed by his female boss and Lois utterly refuses to give him any sympathy, insisting that a man <em>can't</em> be sexually harassed because they like sexual behavior. He also catches flak from his friends (Quagmire saying that he can't not sleep with his boss or else he's gay) and the patrons at the local bar. Later on the boss admits that she's harassing Peter because she hasn't had sex in a long time, and the audience is expected to see this as acceptable and the boss as sympathetic. It also did not help that Peter's boss threatened to kill herself because she fears being alone any longer and feels having sex will make her life have some meaning again.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> episode, "The Strong Arms of the Ma". After bulking up, Marge rapes Homer (who is clearly scared and doesn't want to) violently enough that it hurts to walk the next morning. It's played for laughs, with Marge never apologizing or repenting, and getting away with it.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse">Metalocalypse</a></em> when a group of female villains want to harvest lead-singer Nathan Explosion's "seed" in order to father a race of super-babies and kill him afterword. He is saved by Toki, but later laments in a way that invokes this trope
<div class="indent"><strong>Nathan:</strong> Such a shame, she was so hot. But so f<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundEffectBleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundEffectBleep">*RIFF*</a>kin' crazy. <br/><strong>Toki:</strong> You just figures it out? All the hots ones is crazy! <br/><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah, I guess you're right. <br/><strong>Toki:</strong> And the ugly ones, too.
</div></li><li> In the fifth episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MenInBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MenInBlack">Men in Black</a></em>, a heavyset green female alien falls for Agent J and pins him to the ground to mate with him against his protests. K just chuckles and walks off, saying "Have a good time, kid."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> subverts this, with Death By Snu-Snu. The Zap and Fry know what is going to happen, and try to hide their glee because this is essentially a death sentence and they have no choice in the matter, but can't help but look forward to it.
<div class="indent">"I never thought I'd die this way, but I'd always hoped."
