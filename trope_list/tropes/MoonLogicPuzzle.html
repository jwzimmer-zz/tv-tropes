</p><p>And then sometimes, standard logic just won't get you to the right answer, no matter how hard you try.

The Russian language recognizes dark blue (<em>siniy</em>) as a separate basic color from light blue (<em>goluboy</em>). The range covered by siniy includes a chunk of what an English speaker would call purple, and is "obviously" distinct from <em>goluboy</em>. Purple, on the other hand, is <em>fioletoviy</em>, which more closely matches "violet". Thus, with a simple slip of translation or colorization, a Russian player may be utterly baffled by having two slightly different <em>siniy</em> buttons, no <em>goluboy</em> or <em>fioletoviy</em> buttons, and no hint as to what the problem is.</span>

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LANoire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LANoire">L.A. Noire</a></em> is filled to the brim with this during its interrogations. Typically it's an issue with the game expecting players to understand that they need to purposely ignore logical fallacies, side-step incomplete deductions, and purposely aim for tropes such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByContradiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByContradiction">Conviction by Contradiction</a>. All of which can be incredibly non-intuitive, particularly during the early cases. There is also an issue with the game often expecting players to treat circumstantial conjecture as evidence, and even a couple of moments where Cole will use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Insane Troll Logic</a> to make a correct answer work within the context of the questioning.
<ul><li> One of the most striking examples occurs in the case "The Fallen Idol". You're investigating a car crash to see if it was an attempted murder of the driver and her passenger. At the crime scene, you find ripped underwear belonging to the female passenger, Jessica Hamilton. When you interview the female driver, you ask her about Jessica, and she says that Jessica had a rough day, and has stars in her eyes with dreams of being an actress, ending with "what more can I say?" By this time the player is expected to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">have already pieced together from the highly ambiguous circumstantial evidence (the ripped panties) that Jessica was raped the prior day. The player is then expected to contradict the driver, and present the underwear. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">This prompts Cole to accuse the driver of hiding the fact that Jessica was raped</a>. The clue, of course, was the dismissal "what more can I say?"</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedUpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedUpToEleven">As if this wasn't bad enough,</a> there's also a giant red-herring in the form of a letter from Jessica's mother, revealing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jessica is a runaway</span>. Trying to present <em>this</em> as evidence is a no-go, even though it's also something the driver is hiding. <em>L.A. Noire</em> keeps player statistics for these things, and this particular line of questioning has a 90% failure rate — after hints.
</li><li> Another example comes when Cole asks the husband of a murder victim what size shoes he wears. The husband responds by saying, "size nines, I think." The player needs to accuse him of purposely lying, then present his <em>real</em> shoes... size eights. Not the strongest case, Cole.
</li><li> The game's issues stem from the "Good Cop", "Bad Cop", and "Accuse" system, wherein everyone is being knowingly truthful or lying, without grey areas. While the game sometimes requires normal human intuition/leaps of logic, sometimes it instead wants game logic, leading to great angst.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> was designed with the assumption that players would take it upon themselves to build and use sites like Thottbot, Wowhead, and Wowpedia, and thus save the developers the trouble of explaining anything, ever, either in-game or in documentation. Thus, there are no moon logic puzzles, just a lot of quests where the players have done a better job of explaining your quest objectives than the questgivers.
</li><li> These are somewhat par for the course in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em>. The game's humorous nature means that a lot of puzzles rely on puns, jokes, or even information that is totally unrelated to anything in the game. As a result figuring out new challenges or recipes can take a long time even with large numbers of people working on it.
<ul><li> Riff's ocean puzzle took the player base months to figure out (and they only succeeded after he posted a hint): during exploration of the sea, 43 islands were found that each had a single strange tiki idol, and when those islands were plotted on a grid and connected with lines, they spelled out a name which could be used to summon the tiki god himself.
</li><li> Recipes. "Big Rock + Hot Buttered Roll = Heart of Rock and Roll" almost makes sense in retrospect, but there are others, like "bunny liver + popsicle stick = liver popsicle", that seem to strictly come from left field. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0xxwi');"><sup>explanation </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0xxwi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0xxwi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Popsicle sticks and fruit are acquired in the tutorial area, and the "fruit popsicle" recipe is immediately obvious. Bunny livers are conspicuously marked as cookable ingredients, and are acquired in the <em>other</em> tutorial area, so the recipe is largely an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a> for those players who notice this and immediately think to try it out.</span> And there are others, like lihc eye pie (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">that's the correct in-game spelling</a>), that are based on puns. These also make sense in retrospect, but first have to be found by trial and error.
</li><li> Some of the puzzles require the player to know what the devs' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheyMightBeGiants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheyMightBeGiants">favorite band</a> is. This would be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a> variant, since hints at that very fact are sprinkled throughout the game.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">final form of the final boss</a> is unbeatable without a specific item; if you don't have it, the only hint is that you need to "rearrange the situation." Obviously, this means you need to craft a <em>wand</em> out of giant letters, with which you can kill the boss with <em>anagrams</em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">her otherwise-deadly attacks</a>.
</li><li> Unlocking the hard mode form of the Zombie Homeowners Association boss in Dreadslyvania took the playerbase significantly longer than any other boss in the dungeon. Each boss requires a certain item to be worn or eaten or drunk before fighting them. How do you get the item to trigger the Zombie's hardmode? Obviously you need to get a muddy skirt to drop off of a zombie in the village, get a seed pod from the woods outside the village and then <em>dance in a ballroom</em> while wearing said skirt so that the seed pod breaks open and covers your skirt in seeds that then sprout into weeds. Homeowners <em>hate</em> weeds after all. And this is derived from a specific experience one of the devs had with his own homeowners' association. Players who listened to the radio show may remember him talking about it, but for the majority of players who don't it was completely out of left field.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuest">King's Quest</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestIQuestForTheCrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestIQuestForTheCrown">King's Quest I: Quest For The Crown</a></em> contained one optional puzzle where the player had three attempts to guess a Rumplestiltskin character's name, with the sole hint in the game being a letter saying "sometimes it pays to think backwards". In the original edition, this implied spelling "Rumplestiltskin" using an alphabetic <em>cipher</em> where Z=A, Y=B, and so on (the answer was thus "Ifnkovhgroghprm"); this proved too difficult for most players even in its time, so for the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnhancedRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnhancedRemake">Enhanced Remake</a> the solution was simplified to just spelling "Rumplestiltskin" backwards.

There are no teapots in the game, and the only hint (not explicitly mentioned in the game itself) is that the old hunter's lamp looks a bit like a teapot. Considering that in a previous game (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestIIIToHeirIsHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestIIIToHeirIsHuman">King's Quest III: To Heir Is Human</a></em>) spells had to be cast <em>exactly</em> according to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">instructions</a> (it doubled as the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopyProtection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopyProtection">Copy Protection</a>, so failure meant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveANiceDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveANiceDeath">Have a Nice Death</a>), it's easy for veteran gamers to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">Wrong Genre Savvy</a> on this one.
</li><li> Later on there's an even more unintuitive puzzle: Jollo informs Alexander that you can get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s right hand genie out of the way by switching the genie's lamp with an identical one. Conveniently, there's a peddler selling lamps out on the street but you don't know which lamp to pick. What's the solution? Go to the pawn shop where the genie is there in disguise and make Alexander drink a <em>fake death</em> potion so that a cutscene appears where the genie goes to report this to his master and the player can get a look at the lamp and choose it when Alexander wakes up. What makes this completely out of left field is the fact that not only have the prior cutscenes between the genie and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> not shown the lamp meaning there would be no reason to believe this would work, but the puzzle itself breaks the fourth wall since the knowledge of the lamp's appearance is only shown to <em>the player</em>, meaning that from an in story perspective Alexander got the right lamp via a lucky guess (Alexander himself claims this when he is later asked how he chose the right lamp).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note297bx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note297bx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note297bx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Fake Death potion is actually supposed to be used for a different in-story reason: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYouKnowIKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYouKnowIKnow">Alexander knows that the Vizier knows of his plans to save Cassima</a>, and he also knows (or at least suspects) that the guy following him with glowing gold eyes is the Vizier's genie.

In one chapter, a hunk of green cheese falls into a fountain in the town of Falderal which Chicken Little claims to be the Moon. Despite it being clearly within her reach, Valanice claims she can't reach it. The idea is that, being cheese and in water, it is slippery and has to be retrieved a different way. You must instead obtain a book and trade it to Roo Rat for a shepherd's crook and then use the crook to get the Moon. After being then found guilty of "Moon theft" and ordered to put it back into the sky, you then have to use the rubber chicken and a tree branch resembling a slingshot to fling the Moon back into the sky.

The underground train where there are small noises at each intersection, each different noise indicating a different direction. This particular puzzle is easier if one has completed the Mechanical Age, or at least used the fortress-rotation simulator in another save, as it uses the exact same sound cues. The train puzzle still has a twist, though: at some points, the train needs to go in a secondary direction (southwest, northeast, etc.), and the cues for those consist of two sounds playing at once.

However, there's one particular puzzle in the jungle (specifically, the last puzzle in the first set) that's so excruciatingly hard and makes so little sense, that even the most hardcore fans who otherwise tell people not to use walkthroughs will make an exception with this puzzle, and often refer to it as "the one single puzzle I had to brute force".

It is replicated here in text form for your troping entertainment:
<div class="indent">You are attempting to bypass a gate, which has a high-voltage laser across it. Behind the gate, there is a guard, who has the ability to shut the gate off, and has been instructed to do so only at night. Your task is to somehow trick the guard into shutting off the gate.

Many people thought that when they told you to look on the back of the CD case, they meant the case of the CD you just got in the game (which you can't look at), or another similar in-game item, leading players to wander all over the levels either trying to use the disc, or finding whatever item was being referred to. There is a way around not having the game case: call Campbell about four times and Meryl's number will be added to your list of Codec frequencies.

You need some sticks. That's easy — steal the mallets from croquet players by swapping them with something similar, so that they wouldn't notice. One is simple: a hammerhead shark, who does look like a mallet. Another is OK, if you remember <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlicesAdventuresInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlicesAdventuresInWonderland">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a></em>: a flamingo.

<ul><li> One puzzle which frustrated many players literally requires knowledge of the QWERTY keyboard layout — which is, of course, not actually used within the game, but which can be found within PictoChat on the DS if someone doesn't have a keyboard at hand. It also requires seeing that the candy bar on which the puzzle is written has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> bite marks in it</span> which are easily missed, but which make up part of the solution, and which are not mentioned in <em>any</em> of the in-game hints. Oh, and also, the puzzle is phrased in terms of SMS messaging, thus suggesting a completely different keypad layout that's entirely a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a>. This puzzle was so absurd that it was completely changed in the European release of the game, replaced with a mathematical puzzle. It was probably changed because the QWERTY keyboard isn't consistent throughout Europe. Germany's top row says QWERTZ and France's says AZERTY, for example.
</li><li> One puzzle mentions a device that makes a hole in a piece of paper and then marks the hole with a line. The answer they're looking for is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "compass" as a compass is used to draw a circle by hinging a pin with a pencil</span>. Of course, if you think "line" means "straight curve" you're never going to figure it out and this puzzle comes off as a particularly bizarre jump in logic.
</li><li> Another puzzle features ten lit candles; three have the flame blown out and you are asked how many candles are left "at the end". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The answer is three because the other seven lit candles are allowed to burn until there is nothing left; "at the end" referring to when this has happened.</span>

The bottle contains garlic, and you must block two openings with the corks to stop the person who gave it to you from smelling the garlic. No matter what combination of openings on the bottle you block, you will fail the puzzle because all three of the openings lead to the garlic. The solution is to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> put the corks in the nostrils of the person who gave you the puzzle, which are also openings.

The answer: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">0. Prima just needs to stick it in front of her fireplace. The image displayed during the puzzle does indeed display a fireplace in the background, but the puzzle puts itself as a simple word based mathematics puzzle, meaning that most players just pay attention to the text and take the image as just being there for the sake of flavor.</span>

One of the puzzles gives the player a brief explanation on the pH scale, and describes that pH 3 indicates acid and pH 7 indicates alkaline.

You have to say when the conversation was taking place. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The conversation started on the 31st of December at 11:59 at night and halfway through the sentence it became midnight and the date changed to the 1st of January.

Just one of many leaps in logic you need to make is what to do with the mutant pear you get in the first game; turns out you need to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">dip it in red paint to make it look like an apple and then place it on top of a frightened-looking boy statue so that the second statue(?) of a rabbit aiming an arrow can shoot it off his head a la William Tell.</span> An even more unintuitive case in the second game involves a rabbit Statue of Liberty: you need to use an <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">icepick and a dead frog</span> on it, so that the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">icepick will catch a bolt of lightning and make the frog come back to life</span>.

Sure, most of the riddles still had text in the help menu, but while that might have provided theory, ambiguous wording obfuscated mechanisms. The Death Puzzle in particular is a huge leap from anything else in the game (mostly wordplay and logic challenges). Players needed to catch a fast-moving symbol with the mouse pointer (while avoiding another). The only way to solve the puzzle is to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">interfere with the mini-game by activating the program's pull-down menu, halting the animation and allowing the user to align the mouse for the payoff click, or find a way to move the symbol without moving the mouse (the latter was the intended solution, but the former, a glitch caused by the Macintosh's single-tasking nature, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedGlitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedGlitch">deemed a valid alternate solution by the developer</a>).</span>
</li><li> An example of when this goes wrong can be found in an obscure puzzle game called <em>The Crystal Key</em>. At one point, you're in an alien docking bay, trying to get a ship to take off before a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarthVaderClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarthVaderClone">Darth Vader Clone</a> can find you and force-choke you. All the keys on the ship's control panel are labeled in an alien language. You're supposed to have written down the coordinates of the ship you docked at the very beginning, then you're supposed to enter in those same coordinates. Apparently, it's taken for granted not only that you remember the coordinates, but that you'll know the aliens use base-10, arrange their keys in the same order as on a telephone number pad, and use the same coordinate system as is found in your ship. Note in particular that the keys are arranged as on a <em>telephone</em> keypad, with 123 at the top. Which, of course, is different from the layout of the PC keypad that's likely to be closer at hand for someone playing the game.

Though hinted with various baseball puns and equipment in the room, the concept seems out of place in the fantasy setting, not to mention kind of unfair for non-American players. And even for Americans who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfDirection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfDirection">just don't know the compass directions</a> of baseball fields.

This is also why a left-handed pitcher is called a "southpaw": with home plate in the west corner, a left-hander throws with his southernmost hand.</span> In the hint book they even apologised for what a difficult puzzle it was, in particular for non-American Zorkers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a> Mystery Game</em>:
<ul><li> The game involves a puzzle where you actually have to microwave a cowbell that's lodged inside a block of ice. Metal. In a microwave. Also, you can't enter a maze until you hang one of those little tree-shaped air fresheners on a tree branch. Then, in order to see once you're in the maze involves building a homemade flashlight, one piece of which is behind a refrigerator. Which you're supposed to just push out of the way. That wouldn't be such a leap if you played Fred, but you play <em>Shaggy</em>.
</li><li> Another scenario example is, when having a motor without belt ("They often break"), and a new belt, you should use the belt as a rope in another place, and use toffy instead of belt.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Death Gate</em> had two infuriating puzzles of this type.
<ul><li> One was opening the treasure room in the tower of the Brotherhood. You have a code list, but all it says is "Buy their time to die" above a list of in-universe Arianus continents. You also can find a book that explains the codes change based on the time of month. To open the wall with lots of hands, you have to look at what continent currently obscures the sun from that place, then use that continent to figure out what word to use from the "Buy their time to die" phrase (it's the word above the name of the continent) then if it was for example "die", you have to press Diamond Iron Emerald hands. First letters for the materials they're made of. Aside from the Brotherhood book, and the code list itself, there are NO clues about this whatsoever. Good luck getting this without a walkthrough. They do show you the materials in the item descriptions at least.
</li><li> The second is even more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a>, especially because it's the final puzzle. You have to continuously fend off Sang-Drax while figuring out the correct starting rune for the Interconnection spell. Fending off Sang-Drax is simple enough (figuring out which elemental storm to use against his current form, which isn't hard) but figuring out the starting rune without trial and error is nigh impossible. The character who could tell you the rune is <em>dead</em> so the logical option is to resurrect him. Problem: he only says "the heart, the heart" which is a very obscure reference to a back-then-didn't-seem-important conversation <em>near the beginning of the game</em>. Again, good luck. Fortunately this time there are only six options, logic whittles it down to five, and a possible in-universe logical trick diminishes it to four, so trial and error (along with save scumming) gets there FAST.
<ul><li> If you're desperate and your monitor's contrast is good enough, you can actually make out the answer in your magic book in spite of the damage to the page, rendering your little dabble in necromancy redundant.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnotherCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnotherCode">Another Code</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game has a puzzle where you had to close the DS enough so you could see the reflection of one of the screens on the other without closing it so much it went into standby mode. It also had no hints other then the fact that it was simply a photo frame that folded the same way. Also, should you be playing without a backlight on, good luck seeing the reflection- or, for that matter, be using one of the more recent versions of the DS, in which case the two halves of the clue will not line up properly. Fortunately, simple brute force also works for solving the puzzle.
</li><li> There is one puzzle where you have to complete a picture using a pair of stamps; this is done by closing the DS twice.
</li></ul></li><li> One optional battle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou">The World Ends with You</a></em> pits the player against a pig lying asleep on the battlefield which wakes up and instantly escapes after a single hit. Pigs can usually only be killed by the weakness shown in their thought bubbles. The solution is to close the DS, thereby putting it in "sleep mode," which instantly kills the pig since its weakness was apparently sleep.

<ul><li> At a certain point you have to find something to turn off a pump to reveal a pathway behind a waterfall. The solution was to plug a hypnotized monkey into the pump and turning its tail. Yup, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun">monkey wrench</a>. Bonus points to players of non-English versions, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInTranslation">that's not a puzzle that translates very well</a> — the Spanish version of the game, for one, resorted to putting a book in the Phatt Library which flat-out tells you that monkeys can be used as "English wrenches", the Spanish equivalent of "monkey wrenches".
</li><li> Near the end of the game you have to use an elevator, but the door won't close because the combined weight of Guybrush and a huge immovable crate exceed the weight limit. Guybrush has to be holding a balloon and two surgical gloves filled with helium in order to be light enough to ride the elevator.

<ul><li> At one point you need to make a snake throw up. What's the answer? Put an ipecac flower into a carafe of pancake syrup! <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">There is a hint where you get the flower stating that natives use it as a 'purgative' but if the player is unfamiliar with that words or if they read the hint hours earlier...</span>

</div></li><li> When you first climb aboard the The Sea Cucumber (which is commanded by the Pirates Of Danjer Cove), Mr. Fossey accuses you of trespassing and forces you to walk the plank. Well, that obviously didn't work, so now what? Well, while Mr. Fossey is talking to Captain <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> LeChimp</span>, you need to saw the plank off with the serrated bread knife, which will suddenly lead Mr. Fossey to decide to tar and feather you. By real world logic, a serrated bread knife is hardly strong enough to cut through wood. And Mr. Fossey could've just thrown you overboard instead of going through the trouble of tarring and feathering you after noticing the plank was missing. The remainder of this puzzle is pretty easy. But, unless you're familiar with the cartoonish logic that dominates the Monkey Island games, be prepared to be stumped by puzzles like this.

The player will be hinted toward two questions throughout the game <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"What room do you leave without entering?" and "What room do you enter without leaving?"</span>, twin riddles that will come to haunt you near the end of the game <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in the cult of Amon Ra's secret meeting room</span>.

The solution to almost every puzzle is hidden either in dialog (when you look at a critical item, its ingredients will be described; you will later need to replenish this supply, and to complete a different puzzle you collect the source of these ingredients), in characterization (you need to distract a man; he's a bit of a womanizer, and if you're willing to stretch your imagination real hard, the courtesan outside could be considered mildly attractive), or in the expectation that you will possess some bit of knowledge which is fairly common, but easy to overlook because it's not brought up in conversation much (one puzzle requires you to know basic color theory and the attendant terminology).

<ul><li> The glyph puzzles, where a common theme must be found between paintings, a code cracked, or anomalies found in photographs. Most of them are fine, but one or two of the painting puzzles are outright frustrating if you don't pick up on the weird hints they give you, or haven't been following the framing story too closely. Luckily, if you get it wrong enough times, Shaun Hastings can give you some advice that makes it clearer, but until then, who knows! (and sometimes that doesn't help much) The codes can be even worse.
<ul><li> Of particular note is the code wheel in the 18th glyph- for one thing, it involves Sumerian numerals, and it's highly unlikely you'd know what they were in the first place until Shaun gives you the hint, but even with the hint, it's still an absurdly difficult puzzle.
</li><li> And then there's the code in the 20th glyph, which gives no real hints to the solution, and even Shaun is so puzzled he can't give you any help.
</li><li> The glyph puzzles seem to be targeted directly at players familiar with the puzzle style of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateRealityGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateRealityGame">alternate reality games</a>, and as they're off the critical path you don't actually have to solve them to complete the game.

Checking the Warren Report has a rumour about Hell's Gate opening up, but a player would have to specifically check for that rumour in particular in order to access it. The Shaman sidequest also has a similar example, as well as recruiting all the four sisters - If one has Sisteena and Seleye, they will show up in a scene when Olivia is recruited (she is the only one who joins by default), then before one fights the fourth sister, Shelley, you are given a large hint that she's playable and that you shouldn't kill her.

These are 18 challenges throughout the game that contain 3 or 4 riddles each. Each riddle leads the player to another riddle until they reach the end. What makes this challenging is the locations of the next riddle are never consistent. Sometimes one Enigma's riddles will keep the player within a small area, other times the next riddle will be hundreds of kilometers away.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NancyDrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NancyDrew">Nancy Drew</a></em> game <em>Danger By Design</em> requires purchasing an ancient decoder from a vendor and a book of ciphers from another vendor, then finding a message in the final room, then <em>encoding</em> that message with the date shift cipher from the book, then inputting the encoded message into the decoder to eventually get a message in French with the numbers to unlock the door.

Without casting the spells in the correct order, beating the boss correctly would be impossible. While the correct order <em>is</em> found in a few places in the game, it's very rarely in a way that call attention to it. The most obvious place is a boss that uses it as the answer to riddles, but this is A) optional and B) perfectly possible to mess up.
<ul><li> Also of note is that the tune that the Chrono Cross plays is composed of the first few notes that make up what is the theme song of the game: The Unstolen Jewel.
</li><li> Additionally, the order is intentionally hinted at and countered by the final boss, who will use the opposite element of whatever the next in the order is until he is low on health. When his health is low, he will instead casts the elements in the correct order, allowing you to simply use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> when the pattern is done.

<ul><li> In <em>Trapped</em>, the player is stuck in a room with a locked door, and finds an amputated finger in a wallet, along with some matches. Turns out the finger is artificial, and the player has to use the matches to burn the flesh off the finger to reveal the metal bone, and use that to pick the lock.
</li><li> In <em>Pursuit</em>, the player has to feed a fish to a storekeeper's cat. To do this, the player has to go down to the sewers, coat a banana and a piece of rope with glue, attach the two together, then stick a knife through the banana to make a fishing rod to catch the fish with. The storekeeper thanks you by giving you <em>an empty blowtorch</em>.
</li><li> In <em>Escape</em>, one of the first puzzles involves putting a valuable silver coin in a sink to let the water pour on the floor, and then summoning a guard so that he can slip on it. But that's nothing compared to a later puzzle that involves busting a square-shaped hole in a wall with your bare hands, taking a photo with an inexplicable pinhole in it, hammering a nail over the hole with a toilet lid, putting a lit lamp in the hole then covering it by hanging the photo over it, then clicking where the light shines on the opposite wall to reveal an instant cache with "evidence" in it. <em>There is nothing in the game that hints to this in the slightest.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> Everything about the old PC game that time (wisely) forgot, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodwingsPumpkinheadsRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodwingsPumpkinheadsRevenge">Bloodwings: Pumpkinhead's Revenge</a>,</em> follows a form of moon logic that even the developers probably didn't get half the time, from using a fire extinguisher to cross pools of lava and using a shovel to smash a crystal to upgrade your main weapon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LimboOfTheLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LimboOfTheLost">Limbo of the Lost</a></em> has the now-infamous Soul Vial puzzle, where the player has to obtain a green-tinted vial containing the also-green soul of a warrior. To do this, the player needs to find an empty green-tinted vial, fill it with water (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaterIsBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaterIsBlue">which is rendered as thick blue instead of clear</a>) and mix that with saffron to create a substitute to make the exchange with. This puzzle, of course, not only relies on the fact that the player assumes that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaterIsBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaterIsBlue">Water Is Blue</a> instead of clear, but also assumes that the player knows what saffron is and what it does — and by extension, you would also know that putting saffron in water makes it <em>yellow</em>, not <em>green</em>!
</li><li> At one point in <em>Stupid Invaders</em> you have to get down a hole in the middle of the desert. In order to do this, you have to use a garden hose as a rope. Fair enough. However, instead of throwing one end of the hose down the hole and climbing down, as any normal person would do, the character <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">decides to hold onto the hose and jump down the hole</a></em>. Since he held onto a point of the hose that was too low, he smashes on the ground and dies. So what do you do? The interface doesn't allow you to tell him to just climb down the hose or to hold onto a higher point of it. Turns out, you need to find a skull in the desert and use its teeth <em>to cut the hose shorter</em>. Yeah, that's right, the character simply refuses to hold onto the correct point of the hose until it has been shortened for no good reason at all! Guess they call the game <em>Stupid Invaders</em> for a reason...
</li><li> Some of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em>'s quests have puzzles like this. Some just plain have ridiculous logic, while others are just stupid hard.
<ul><li> Just one example. At one point, you find yourself in a prison cell. You need to attract the attention of your deaf neighbour through the window between your cells. To do this <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">punch a hole in an accordion with a broken ink bottle, put a pipe into the hole, airproof the hole with inky paper, use your makeshift vacuum pump to catch a seagull, then play the accordion to <em>fire the seagull into your neighbour's room</em></span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Collecting a footprint clue in <em>Murder on the Orient Express</em> requires that you cast the thing in cake batter, then prevent the batter from falling apart by putting it in a big bowl of ice. Even your character's own dialogue admits how goofy the resulting "evidence" looks.
</li><li> Many puzzles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3">Silent Hill 3</a></em> become this on Hard Riddle difficulty.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://everything2.com/title/Silent+Hill+3">This hideous puzzle<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, involving a keypad, and a poem about mutilating a face from which you are supposed to deduce the code. Even if you manage to figure out that the face corresponds to the keypad, you also need to figure out what parts of the face correspond to which buttons, and even then you end up with five numbers instead of the four needed. If you want to know exactly how much effort it asks of you to solve it, see <a class="urllink" href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/914765-silent-hill-3/faqs/78065">here (search for "puz_02")<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for the solution. It doesn't help that a note from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stanley</a> about the puzzle mentions "4 numbers would've been good enough, but he kept on going", even though the code <em>is</em> only four numbers. Even worse, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWo_aivgxrs&amp;t=9m53s">it turns out the puzzle was made much, much harder due to a miscommunication during development.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The writers assumed the first row of the keypad would be "7-8-9", and the artists assumed the first row would be "1-2-3", and then when someone tried to fix the puzzle to match the new keypad layout, they switched two of the numbers.
</li><li> Even worse is the Crematorium puzzle on Hard, where you are required to know the habits of a bird most people have never heard of, and the hint also contains a false pointer. <a class="urllink" href="https://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3577729&amp;userid=162441#post428452588">Like the keypad puzzle, this was made harder due to a developer error.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The dev notes say you're supposed to rank the birds in order from Heaven to Hell once you've figured out which stanza matches which bird. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">This is never mentioned anywhere in game.</a>
</li><li> Hard Mode has the Shakespeare puzzle, which requires intimate knowledge of Shakespeare's plays to decipher a numeric code. Failing that, you had other subtle clues in most of them to decipher if you don't. The first two stanzas aren't too hard to match up, but the other three are trickier (it doesn't help that <a class="urllink" href="https://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3577729&amp;userid=162441#post421411171">even the developer notes are vague about which stanzas match which play, or even if the "one stanza = one play" rule still applies<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.) Even if you figure that out, you still have to figure out that the last stanza doesn't refer to a play at all, but means that you need to multiply two of the numbers corresponding to the plays and remove another one.

As noted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd">Angry Video Game Nerd's</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-6WakV0kWM#t=01m33s">review<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, most players would think to find a phone in-game to call Jessica with, when they actually have to call her toll-free number <em>in real life</em> and get the clues from Jessica's recording. But don't bother calling nowadays; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">it now leads to a porn line</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLongestJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLongestJourney">The Longest Journey</a></em>:
<ul><li> At the beginning of the game you need to get a large piece of iron off an electrified metro track. How does one accomplish this feat? By combining a clamp, a clothesline and a rubber ducky. And to get the clamp you need to use the ring your father gave you to close an electrical circuit to fix the plumbing system of your apartment building so the clamp isn't needed to hold a pipe shut? And the duck requires the player to feed a pigeon outside their window, and it will fly down to the grate in the canal the duck is trapped under. The pigeon jars the grate, which both releases the duck, and the chain the clothesline is on. The worst part is that this action is prone to a bug in which April will act as though there's something missing from your Rube Goldberg contraption — so that even if you managed to figure it out, you <em>still</em> might be told that you're wrong (incidentally, this is one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">several glitches</a> which can only be got around by restoring a previous saved game). Also, there's a band-aid on the duck. April has to remove the band-aid, blow up the duck, and then remove it so it'll deflate and the clamp will close automatically. This puzzle stands in stark contrast to most of the other ones in the game, seeing as they are generally based on <em>actual logic</em>, instead of a college student, for no good reason, meddling with several pieces of machinery she has no business operating.
<div class="indent"> <strong><a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19974_the-6-most-absurdly-difficult-video-game-puzzles.html">Cracked.com<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>:</strong> Now you're ready to get that key! Wait, what key? Oh, right — you were doing something at some point before you got high and started fucking with these birds.
</div></li><li> Later on, you have to take some candy from the bar April works at. Problem is, if the player chooses to look at the bar instead of manipulating it, April specifically says her boss doesn't like the employees eating the candy. The player might reasonably assume that this is just for the characterization of April's boss, and they shouldn't or can't take the candy, and not even bother to try. The player, admittedly, might decide to go all the way back to the bar just to retrieve the candy when they need it, so they can <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">roll it in stinky ooze and give it to a cop. The cop spits it out, and the guy he's watching thinks it was on purpose and chases him off. Yes, April will decide to, as far as she knows, <em>poison a police officer</em> to meet her admittedly-desperate goals.</span>
</li><li> How do you remove a police officer from an accident scene? Bribe him with a soda, which the game indicates is the right thing to use? Nah, that won't work. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ride the subway clear across town to put the soda in the paint shaker you may have noticed some time ago, then ride the subway all the way back, then walk to the cop and hand him the soda which has somehow not gone flat so that it sprays him in the face, forcing him to leave to change his armor?</span> Correct! Please note that the solution is, in essence, intuitive, but the game forces the player to go about it in a really convoluted way. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The game could've simply had April shaking up the soda behind her back before handing it to the cop.</span> It would've been a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>, but given that the audience knows April is an intelligent and capable young woman, it would probably be a more logical solution than the one that made it into the game.
</li><li> A powerful wizard can be defeated by handing him a calculator, causing him to be sucked inside when he starts messing with it. Why? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">Fan Wank</a> has suggested that it is something to do with the calculator being an object of pure logic that conflicts with the wizard's magical nature but the game doesn't bother to explain this at any point.

The solution is to entice your pet rat to fetch it for you with a granola bar. If you listed the hundred most intuitive ways to retrieve a wallet from under a couch, this almost certainly wouldn't be on there.

<div class="indent"><em>"Most of your average adventure game experience was spent carting a truckload of miscellaneous knick-knacks around, patiently rubbing them all one by one against everything else in the hope of hopping onto the train of logic unique to the game's designer."</em>
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams">Douglas Adams</a>'s text adventure <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bureaucracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bureaucracy">Bureaucracy</a></em> is filled with this; in order to progress, you frequently have to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Insane Troll Logic</a> to deal with a world designed and run by demented <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrats</a>. (For example, a creditor sends you a "bill" in the form of a check for <em>negative</em> three hundred dollars. Simple; deposit it in your account, but use a withdrawal slip instead of a deposit slip. Since the negative of a withdrawal is a deposit, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">the negative of negative three hundred dollars is three hundred dollars</a>.)
</li><li> The text adventure version of Douglas Adams's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></em> is notorious for abusing the player with this kind of puzzle logic. In order to solve one particular puzzle, you are told that you need to show exceptional intelligence. A bit of research in the Guide reveals that in order to do so, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you need to both have something and <em>not</em> have something at the same time.</span> Given that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "no tea"</span> is listed as an inventory item—and has been since the beginning of the game—it's increasingly clear you need to find some <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> tea</span>. However, there doesn't seem to be any source for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> tea</span> in the game. Even a machine that seems perfectly suited to dispense it will, maddeningly, produce a product that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike it. It's not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockLateralThinkingPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockLateralThinkingPuzzle">Stock Lateral Thinking Puzzle</a> either—you can't simply <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">DROP NO TEA</span> to get it. Once you finally <em>do</em> get <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the tea, after acquiring a proper interface for the Nutrimat</span>, you <em>still</em> have to deal with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> getting both the "tea" and the "no tea" at the same time, as "your common sense tells you you can't do that"</span>. You eventually have to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">go inside your own brain and remove said common sense, which finally allows you to possess the tea and the "no tea" at the same time. Oh, by the way, even after removing your common sense, you <em>still</em> can't DROP NO TEA if you don't have tea, though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformingTheFourthWall">message changes</a> to reflect your newfound lack of common sense.</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams">Douglas Adams</a> once described the game as moving beyond user-unfriendly, to user-hostile.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarshipTitanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarshipTitanic">Starship Titanic</a></em> can be like this at times. Even one of the developers admitted "These are not the thoughts of a normal person" when discussing a puzzle that involved a chicken and a suction tube. Specifically, you need to pick up a metal bowl. The metal bowl is fastened to the table it's on. The fastener is easily undone, but you can't reach it because the bowl is full of pistachio nuts. Rather than, say, eating some of the nuts or scooping them out of the bowl, you have to send the ship's parrot through the on-board vacuum-tube based mail system to the room where the bowl is, so it can eat them for you.
</li><li> In <em>Time, Gentlemen, Please!</em> (the sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BenThereDanThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BenThereDanThat">Ben There, Dan That!</a></em>), there's a moment where you have to uncork a bottle, obtaining both the cork and the bottle's contents. The bottle is made of glass. However, Ben pointedly refuses to break the bottle with any of the heavy or sharp junk in his inventory, and refuses to open it with his bottle opener magnet, insisting on uncorking it. Turns out uncorking it requires a pig's corpse and a time machine.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario">Super Paper Mario</a></em>'s fifth chapter, all the Cragnons are kidnapped by the Floro Sapiens. Now, seeing this, you'll more than likely go ahead and follow them, hoping to save them. Your progress will then be stopped by a series of three blocks. Seeing this, maybe some people will realize that you need to hit these in a specific combination. Not too difficult, you only had to hit each of the three blocks once. However, you'll later come across another series of blocks. If you tried to hit them once each again, you'll be waiting a while. Turns out this combination is much, much longer. So how does one figure out this combination? Well, it turns out the Floro Sapians didn't kidnap all of the Cragnons, just a lot of them. If you go back, you'll find several, specifically one named Jasperoid, who will give you this combination. But only if you'll ask for it nicely, for which you have to type in the word "please" five times. He'll then give you the combination. Also, some may be tripped up by the fact that the combination is spread on two different text sheets, which you may think implies that there is a third series that the second sheet is for. It's all for that one, second series. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">And the "please" dialogue box is case sensitive, and you have to do it several times to finally get him to tell you.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Strife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Strife">Strife</a></em> features an interesting mess. A man at the tavern asks you to steal a chalice from the Order's sanctuary and bring it to the governor for a reward. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This will probably get you killed when the governor locks his office door and sics several dozen Order mooks on you. You can escape out a window but it's still a pretty bad idea.</span> You wouldn't figure this out unless you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">talked with the guy you were sent to kill by another man</span> and managed to put two and two together. Notably, doing this early on makes the game unwinnable since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after finishing a few Front missions, you need to talk to the Governor to get your next mission. So even if you survive the attack you cannot advance the plot.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Earthbound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Earthbound">Earthbound</a></em> parodies these.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/GrimFandango" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/GrimFandango">Grim Fandango</a></em> mostly plays fair with its hints (and changed the genre by trying to make it obvious what objects could and could not be interacted with), but it has a few of these, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappointingLastLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappointingLastLevel">mostly late in the game</a>:
<ul><li> At one point, you're trying to get into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">the lair of a psychotic florist</a> without him shooting you. He's holed up, yes, a florist shop, where everything is covered with cloth and/or tape. How do you get him to calm down and stop taking potshots? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cut the tape off the bell above the door, go out, and come back in. The noise of it ringing makes him go into "florist mode," and talk to you normally.</span>
</li><li> At another, a bouncer is keeping you from meeting with the mob boss who runs the casino you're both standing in, unless you prove that you know said mob boss by answering a series of number-based questions about him ("How many Limos does Hector LeMans own?"). You know none of these things, but you will inexplicably succeed if you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">always answer the number that just won on the roulette wheel behind you.</span>
</li><li> And then there's the one you solve using something an NPC said to you in passing <em>in an optional conversation</em> 8-ish hours (or four in-world years) ago. You need to find something that can be used as fuel. You have a coffee mug. There is a coffin full of packing foam. There is a room with a toaster that catches fire if you put buttered bread in it. The station employees will put out the fire using fire extinguishers if that happens. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fill the mug with packing foam, place it next to the toaster, and put bread and butter in the toaster. The fire extinguisher spray will chemically react with the packing foam and make the mug jet around the room.</span> If you missed the optional conversation or forgot about it, you have absolutely no way of knowing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the extinguishers and packing foam will react together like that</span>.
</li><li> Yet another illogical puzzle involves you trying to retrieve your car from a booby trapped garage. The villain has rigged a bomb that will be set off if you disturb the giant domino chain that runs all over the floor and the hero is not confident of his ability to step through the trap or disarm it by removing dominoes from the chain. The solution is to have Glottis drink a huge vat of liquid and then make him queasy so that he violently vomits all over the floor. The liquid can then be frozen with liquid nitrogen to prevent the dominoes from moving, although quite why uncontrollably puking over the dominoes is considered less risky than manually picking them up is not explained. Luckily you are stuck in quite a small area with few items so it isn't hard to find the solution.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Albion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Albion">Albion</a></em> has a weird little example. You are in a room. There are two doors and a sign on the wall saying you may go through the doors if you want. Naturally, if you try to open the doors, they are locked. The solution? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Well, if you try a door a second time, it will open with no problem.</span> Likely, you'll puzzle over it for some time the first time and try everything (there's not much you can do), and then manage to get out without knowing how you did it, but if trying it a second time immediately see what the trick was.
</li><li> In order to beat the next to last level of the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> game for Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, you need to destroy a computer terminal and wait for Professor Xavier to tell you to "Reset the computer now!"

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoodleGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoodleGod">Doodle God</a></em> is this. It's all that is.

</li><li> 7th Level's <em>Monty Python and the Quest for the Holy Grail</em> involved this throughout the whole game. A parody of point-and-click adventure games, this involved a really long registration process at the very beginning. Guess what? The registration is necessary to complete a later section. Fortunately, you get to go back if you didn't complete it the first time around.

It featured a very nonsensical puzzle that includes using honey on an old piece of tape to steal hair from a cat, to make a fake mustache, to impersonate someone, to get a motorcycle, because the hero refuses to drive a scooter. The guy you are impersonating doesn't have a mustache. You also need to steal his driver's license and find a pen, to draw a mustache on his picture. The last part makes some sense, as an eye-catching feature on a face draws attention away from a face's bone shape, and other characters hint at this; but it does nothing to explain how cat hair glued with maple syrup can make a convincing moustache.
<ul><li> In addition, the article highlighted there was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">Interface Screw</a> aspect as well; several objects involved in the puzzle don't show up as interactive <em>until</em> you've reached the point in the plot where the puzzle must be solved, but at the same time they have nothing particular to do with the puzzle, so the only way to find them was to visit every previous location and mouse over everything to find if something had become available that wasn't before.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDig">The Dig</a></em> had a couple of spots like that.

Often times it makes sense; you put the "Lightning Stone" into the exactly-same-shaped-hole in a device to power it up, that sort of thing.

The puzzle consists of three goat statues with differently-shaped bases, three correspondingly-shaped holes they need to go into, and a floor that changes colors where one goat has passed, so <em>the others won't cross its trail</em>. It would be an impressively tough puzzle anyway, but the hint pretty much tells you the <em>opposite</em> of what you need to know to solve it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingVideoGameHelper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingVideoGameHelper">Insight Psynergy</a> maps a possible solution <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless">if you think to use it here</a>.</span>
<ul><li> The previous game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunTheLostAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunTheLostAge">Golden Sun: The Lost Age</a></em>, had the secret to navigating to Lemuria cryptically explained through a completely missable and rather convoluted children's song in a remote and completely optional town on an entirely different continent.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork">Mega Man Battle Network</a> 3</em> features one combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInTranslation">Lost in Translation</a>. There's this sidequest called "Legendary Tomes", in which an NPC asks you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">find the three legendary tomes</a> that were stolen from him, and bring them back to him. The three tomes are Earth, Sky, and Sea, and you eventually find them in the possession of random Undernet thugs. But you're told a few vague hints about a "secret" the tomes have, and you're given fragments of a riddle (Sky upon Earth upon Sea) to go with them. Turns out, they point to hidden treasure. But there's a catch. Several, in fact:
<ul><li> In order to get the treasure, you need to have the tomes on you. Which means you need to solve the riddle and hunt down the treasure <em>before giving the tomes back to your client</em>, or it'll be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">lost</a>. Nothing hints at this, and it runs contrary to RPG sidequest logic, which generally rewards you for being nice and returning the NPC's lost items as soon as possible. (and nearly every other job request in this game has pretty much played that straight)
</li><li> Secondly, that "Sky above Earth, Earth above Sea" thing? It's not as obvious as it sounds. If you look at each tome in your key items menu, you'll see their description, followed by a seemingly random series of black blobs and dashes. What do you need to do? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Stack the three tome's lines on top of each other, in the order the riddle says.</span> Then you'll reveal a message...
</li><li> And herein lies the third problem. You see, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus">the message is in Japanese.</a> So if you haven't studied that language, you're stuck here. Oh, and it doesn't really look like writing either unless you know in advance it's supposed to be text (basically imagine trying to spell out 'Hello' using 6 LEGO bricks). Furthermore, it's a Hiragana word written in Katakana, which could throw off even fluent speakers. Presuming you recognised it's writing and can read Japanese, you now need to know what it means. It says <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "Haniwa". Translation: "unglazed earthen objects fashioned in ancient Japan".</span> So now what?
</li><li> As it turns out, this refers to a random object that appeared to be nothing but decoration in an area you visited right at the start of the game. In the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Teacher's Lounge</span> is a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> statue</span> that fits the description of a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Haniwa</span>. Except it was never referred to as a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Haniwa</span> before. And if you're not Japanese, you probably don't know what a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Haniwa</span> looks like anyway.
</li><li> What makes this even worse is that when you FINALLY find it, which REALLY isn't likely without a guide, Megaman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Handwaves</a> the whole thing by claiming the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> statue</span> has symbols on it that match the tomes. Symbols that <strong>are not visible to the player!</strong> Thankfully, the reward for all this is just money.

You explore a bit and... you're stuck. The path just <em>ends</em>.

The solution is extremely obscure, requiring you to shorten each class's name to a two-letter abbreviation (something which is never brought up) and arranging the schedule like a grid where each day of the week is one row (which is not exactly obvious since there are more blank spots on the schedule than the two you need to fill). On this grid, each diagonal line consists of the same letter, at which point you can deduce the two classes. Fortunately, you can just ask Naoto to solve the puzzle for you, which was probably what players were expected to do as a way to establish her genius deductive skills.

The rules of this area are as follows: once you've entered, you can't find the exit, but one person <em>did</em> get out by using a mirror to find it. The solution requires you to notice that the rumour system relies on exact wording (which was pointed out subtly in the previous dungeon). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">No one knows where the exit is, which means that an exit must exist. One person got out, so finding it <em>is</em> possible. A mirror reflects things, including the normally unseeable exit. This means you can find the exit by looking at it indirectly. The party accidentally broke their only mirror, but another party member has a digital camera, which can <em>take a photograph of the exit</em>. Doing so allows her to point out where the exit is, revealing it to the rest of the party.</span> Maya will explain how the puzzle works to you if you don't figure it out, but if you <em>do</em> work it out, it feels awesome.

These mostly pop up for the Magic User, who tends to be a more cerebral class to begin with.
<ul><li> In particular, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool">WIT</a> entrance exams require some particularly outside-the-box thinking.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6ubqa');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6ubqa" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6ubqa');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The best and most devilish is acknowledged by the game. You have to open a door to expose the fire beyond it, then deal with the fire, after which you have to figure out some way to cross the gap the fire has burned in the path ahead. Assuming you've figured out that you can turn the door into a bridge, you still have a problem in that the door is wide open, preventing you from using it as a bridge. While you have an Open spell, you have no such thing as a Close spell. The solution is to use your <em>Fetch</em> spell on the door, which pulls it towards you, swings it on the hinges, and closes it, at which point the game explicitly states "Hey, are you just guessing here, or do you actually know what you're doing?"</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGloryIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGloryIV">Quest for Glory IV</a></em> had one created in the German translation of the game. At one point when trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FighterMageThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FighterMageThief">get into the Thief's guild as a Thief</a> you are confronted with a colour coded box.

In English this is Bad Boys Yell, Good Girls Giggle, Rich Girls Run to link up to the colour panels you can use (Blue Blue Yellow, Green Green Green, Red Green Red.) but in German this becomes "Böse Buben Schreien, Gutes Madchen Lachen, Reichen Madchen Rennen" which provides no clue.
</li><li> Another for <em>Quest for Glory IV</em> <em>in theory</em> is that you need to get Bonehad a hat to gain access to Baba Yaga's hut. But you can't just go and <em>buy</em> him one. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Instead this requires completing a small and unrelated subquest by reuniting senile old Nikolai with his deceased wife, Anna.

The puzzles in the game are usually either this or block puzzles, though sometimes both. The most common general principle is that areas will often change when you aren't looking at them.
</li><li> Early on in the Very Big Cave Adventure, you come across a small spring with a little fence by it. After this, you can expect to wander aimlessly until you realise that the whole point of the game is to find valuable objects and take them to the fence for money. Yeah, <em>that</em> sort of fence.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killer7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killer7">Killer7</a></em>'s puzzles are fairly easy to solve (especially when you can usually pay a guy to have him flat out tell you the solution,) but the logic behind them is frequently no less esoteric, like filling a vase with water to get an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SolveTheSoupCans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SolveTheSoupCans">Odd Engraving</a> to float to the top to grab it, instead of just turning the vase upside down and dumping it out, or summoning a pigeon by flushing a toilet.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI">The Legend of Zelda I</a></em> has many hints that are near impossible to decode thanks to their vagueness and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Engrish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Engrish">Engrish</a>. One particular hint from an old man says "THERE IS A SECRET WHERE FAIRIES DON'T LIVE". Secrets in the game usually mean a hidden entrance that can be revealed by bombing a wall/rock or burning a bush, but the hint only tells you that there's something in an area where there's a lake but no fairies in it. What do you do? Use the Recorder to drain the lake and reveal a hidden staircase. Nothing in the game tells you that the Recorder has such power. Nintendo Power contained a short story soon after the debut of the game that narrated Link being stumped by this riddle, and sitting down next to the lake to relax and think the problem through. How does he relax? He takes out his recorder and plays some music. Given that the recorder usually whisks you away to a place that contains active enemies, this is especially counterintuitive an action, but the hint worked.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaPhantomHourglass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaPhantomHourglass">The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</a></em>, there is a puzzle in the Temple of the Ocean King where you have to stamp your map with a mark to find the next spirit. The stamp is on the touch screen, your map on the top screen. How do you mark your map with the stamp? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">Close the DS</a> so the stamp is "pressed" into your map. This still makes some clever sense if you're playing on a 3DS, but will prove impossible to figure out to anyone playing the game for the first time on any console that doesn't have a clamshell design; playing on other consoles like the 2DS or Wii U require the player to enter sleep mode or back out into the home menu.

In the first dungeon, there's a room with a pool of water and a floating platform moving back and forth, which you have to ride in order to reach the other side, but the way is blocked by a spiked log. The original game has a switch that lowers the water level, creating a safe gap between the log and the platform. This switch is gone in the Master Quest. The solution? <em>Roll</em> under the log (or "crouch" with your shield).

But when all else fails, play the Song of Time - you might just make a block materialize out of thin air. Because by the time you get to the temples, you're expected to know that playing the Song of Time when Navi turns green would make a giant blue block appear, because similar blocks <em>removed</em> with the song earlier would reappear when playing the song again, and Navi turned green around them. Furthermore, playing the song while <em>standing</em> on (or under) one of these time blocks doesn't affect it at all, which of course you have to find out by yourself (thankfully it's not above a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit">Bottomless Pit</a>). Probably the most egregious example is in the Spirit Temple: in one room, you have to play the Song of Time <em>three</em> times at very specific locations, in order to safely drop a box you need to hold down a switch from one time block to another so you can reach it, and if you screw up, the box falls into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit">Bottomless Pit</a> instead and you have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleReset" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleReset">Puzzle Reset</a>.

Late in the game, a corrupt cop catches up to Max and gets ready to stuff him in the trunk. Max needs to find a quick way to take the cop out, with only a bottle of ink, a bottle of whisky, a magnet, two keyrings, and a document. Smash the whisky bottle over his head?

</li><li> There's an obscure series of first-person web games by flash developer Afro-Ninja, the <em>Escape Series</em>. In each game, you're trapped in a different location <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">under vaguely sinister, unexplained circumstances</a>, and have to escape in the shortest possible amount of time by exploring your surroundings and using the odd found object or two that just happens to conveniently be laying around. There's no real story beyond that and no time limit, but there is a counter that records how long it takes for you to solve the puzzle and escape. The puzzles are intuitive just frequently enough to keep you from pulling your hair out, but the games are generally very unfair with their hints. Playing any one of them blind will frequently take at least ten minutes.
</li><li> There are several of these in the game <em>Monty Python's The Meaning of Life</em>.
<ul><li> For example on the last level you need to generate power by turning a wheel, and you have a Rude French Mouse and several types of cheese. Since the Rude French Mouse doesn't want any of the cheese you have to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">use the mouse on a giant man's head to get a small elephant, use the Chocolate Mousse recipe to make a peanut, and convince the elephant to run in the wheel by placing the peanut nearby.</span> You use the cheese to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">build a tower that lets you get into the attic.</span>
</li><li> You also bring a dead parrot back to life using <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">spam, lupins, and a gumby brain surgeon.</span>
</li><li> Another one, which many players could only solve by forcing themselves to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TryEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TryEverything">Try Everything</a>, has several ingredients being put through grinders and added to a bowl to make the infamous salmon mousse from the film. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The trick is not to use the grinders - just put all the ingredients directly into the bowl.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Deponia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Deponia">Chaos on Deponia</a></em> has an especially awful puzzle that relies on Moon Logic AND <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrueltyIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrueltyIsTheOnlyOption">Cruelty Is the Only Option</a> to solve.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrokenSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrokenSword">Broken Sword</a></em> has these in several games. At one point in the second games one of the players solves a puzzle and notes that it was done "Using the form of lateral thinking that can get you institutionalized."
</li><li> The superhero adventure game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Noctropolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Noctropolis">Noctropolis</a></em>, is full of these. To enter a cathedral guarded by a lethal, flying gargoyle, the player must A) locate the couple pixels representative of the only loose bar in the iron-wrought fence, B) open utility panel of a nearby streetlight, C) attach fifty-pounds worth of cable to connect the fence post to an arbitrary lead, and d.) throw the bar, like a spear, some 20-yards so that it lands upon the fountain on which the beast occasionally perches so that it is electrocuted the following time it does. This puzzle was one of the first in the game and significantly simpler than later examples.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CurseOfEnchantia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CurseOfEnchantia">Curse of Enchantia</a></em> is composed mostly of these puzzles; as a largely textless adventure game with little dialogue, everything is conveyed via thought balloons and similar image bubbles. This leads to very bizarre puzzles, but even that is no excuse once the game takes a turn for the completely surreal. For instance—at one point, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext">your path will be blocked by an anthropomorphic nose</a>. There is no reason given for why it's there or why it wants to stop you, you just have to get past it somehow. What you have to do is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">find a giant pile of cut hair on the ground a few screens back, grab a handful of hair, and shove it into the nose to make it sneeze itself out of the way.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilenceOfTheSleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilenceOfTheSleep">Silence of the Sleep</a></em> generally averts this trope with logical puzzles like matching the rotating segments of a skeleton key to a painting of a city skyline (the arrangement of buildings and their reflections is identical to the required arrangement of grooves on a key). Some puzzles still require rather illogical thinking, though.
</li><li> 3D Puzzle game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Outcry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Outcry">Outcry</a></em> had invoked this on purpose in its latter half, where the landscape is shaped by your brother's subconscious. While the previous puzzles were mainly about studying abandoned/incomplete instructions to operating mysterious machinery, the puzzles in the so-called "Shimmering World" will have connections to psychotropic drugs, ancient monoliths and other things your brother knew very well but the player might struggle to figure out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnotherWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnotherWorld">Another World</a></em> had a particularly obnoxious one near the end of the game, where you climb a flight of stairs to encounter an armed alien soldier. Instead of immediately blowing him away like any other enemy, you instead have to run to the other side of the room where, instead of blowing <em>you</em> away at first sight like any other enemy soldier, he'll instead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">start deploying mobile bombs that will never reach you and instead travel down the stairs</a> and explode on the screen below you, blowing a hole in the floor. But you can't stop him after just one! You have to let him deploy about <em>five</em> of these things before they break through the floor completely. If you screw up and kill him before that, it's time to suicide and start over.

The only hints you get to the solution lie in a cryptic hint that the answer is the "age of the full moon" and that there is some Japanese writing that Aya can't read. The puzzle is optional, but failing to complete it locks you out of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OutOfOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OutOfOrder">Out of Order</a></em> has a couple:
<ul><li> At one point, you need to obtain a device called a "MotorTroll" from a shopkeeper named Bob. It just happens that Bob has a bunch of cardboard boxes behind his shop, including one for the MotorTroll. If you look into it, you obtain an instruction manual, and if you look into it again you get a warranty. If you show Bob the warranty he'll say that he'll give you a new MotorTroll, but only if you bring him the old broken one. So what do you do? You're supposed to mess with an electrical transformer in the doctor's office to obtain a pile of burnt-out wires, and show them to Bob claiming that they're the broken MotorTroll. There's absolutely nothing connecting the wires and MotorTroll other than the fact that they're both electronic.
</li><li> The puzzle required to obtain the bumper sticker. You need to prove to the doctor that you own a car so that he'll give it to you. How do you do that? How about going into the doctor's reception office, looking in the toy box to get a toy car, looking again to get a doll, going through more convoluted and unrelated steps to convince the doctor you're sick so you can steal his scalpel while he's looking up your symptoms, use the scalpel to remove the doll's head and cut out the photo from your ID card, stick the photo on the doll and then the doll on the toy car, then go through even more unrelated steps to get your celebrity neighbor to talk to you about her interest in photographing objects, then give her the car with doll, then wait until the photo is complete, then <em>finally</em> showing the photo of the doll in the car to the doctor so he'll give you the bumper sticker? For starters, there's no reason to think of using the scalpel on the doll unless you already knew the full solution beforehand.

First you're required to remember how many experience points your character has (and no, you can't look it up at that point), then you're asked several questions about real-world trivia. You have only ten seconds to answer each question, and if you aren't intimately familiar with U.S. culture (e.g. "How many home runs did the Sultan of Swat [i.e. Babe Ruth] hit?") or nerd culture ("How many crew members were on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">the U.S.S. Enterprise?</a>"), you're screwed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateExtellaTheUmbralStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateExtellaTheUmbralStar">Fate/Extella: The Umbral Star</a></em>, unlocking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Artoria Pendragon</a> as a playable character is a doozy to say the least. The first thing you do is go into your system settings and set your clock between 3:00 and 4:00 pm if you have version 1.00 of the game. This is only for patch 1.00 of the game (if you have patch 1.01 then you can skip this part). Next up you'll need to choose one of the main levels with a "Mystery" side mission on any difficulty. Then, you have to complete the Regime Matrix but <strong>don't</strong> defeat the boss in the stage. From there, you'll need to go to one of the following locations: Sector D in the Jeanne d'Arc stage of Nero's arc; Sector J in the Nameless stage of Tamamo's arc; Sector E in the Cu Chulainn stage of Altera's arc; or Sector H in the Tamamo stage of the Special arc. After completing the Regime Matrix and have gone to one of those sectors, begin to kill the enemies and make them drop health power-ups. Consume 5 health power-ups<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8nlhp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8nlhp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8nlhp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Being low on health (when the health bar starts flashing red) makes enemies drop more health power-ups.</span> in that sector after completing the Regime Matrix. After completing those steps you'll be informed that Artoria, King of Knights, will challenge you to a fight. Once you defeat Artoria (force her to retreat) you'll need to defeat the boss Servant and then you'll unlock her as a playable character.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheMysteryOfTheDruids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheMysteryOfTheDruids">The Mystery of the Druids</a></em> opens with one of these. You need to contact someone by phone; your office phone in Scotland Yard doesn't let you make external calls. There's a pay phone available, but you don't have change. None of your co-workers will let you use their phone, and nobody will give you change or make change for you. The solution: talk to a hobo on the street, and have him ask you for a drink. Then go to the Scotland Yard lab, tease the lab technician about having alcohol in the lab, and have him dare you to drink medical alcohol. Drink it, pass out, wake up, use fingerprinting powder on the bottles to see which one held the medical alcohol (even though it's labelled), tip it into a bottle with some apple juice, and feed it to the hobo - who falls unconscious letting you steal the change out of his hat. This becomes even more ridiculous when later in the game, your boss actually chews you out for doing such a ridiculous thing. Yes, it's the only solution.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII">Dark Souls II</a></em> has Earthen Peak, a giant windmill tower filled with deadly poison, including inside the boss room. How does one remove the poison? Why, set the blades of the windmill on fire with your torch, of course! Despite there being no indication in any of the games that you can do this to an environmental object (only enemies can normally be struck with the torch) and it being in no way obvious that the windmill mechanism is pumping the poison (most of it is just sitting in still pools with no obvious source.)
</li><li> In the titular Ringed City from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII">Dark Souls III</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC">DLC</a>, there's a wall with the inscription "Show Your Humanity". How do you show your humanity? Being embered? Unequipping your armor to show your human-looking skin? Bringing some specific NPC with you? No, you have to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">step into the water outside, use a Young White Branch (or cast the Chameleon spell) to transform into a Humanity sprite from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls1">Dark Souls 1</a></em>, and then walk back up to the wall while transformed, which reveals a ladder leading up a hidden path. There's absolutely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">no indication whatsoever</a> that using an item or sorcery that normally disguises you as something found in the local scenery suddenly transforms you into a <em>Humanity sprite</em> in a specific area, let alone that you have to transform into something at all, other than an obscure connection to the lore.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Paradigm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Paradigm">Paradigm</a></em>, being a surrealist point-and-click adventure game that pays homage to obtuse point-and-click adventures from the 90s, is chock full of these. For example, the puzzle to obtain crack for the local drug addict so he'd let you have some backup disks needed for the power plant's computer so it doesn't melt down. This requires solving a three-layer nested puzzle that requires you to move around several locations and can take several hours to solve if you don't know what you're doing. Even if you know what you're doing, it takes about half an hour to move around and solve the puzzles. And no, it doesn't get easier once you gain access to the drug dealer's mansion.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthwormJim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthwormJim">Earthworm Jim 2</a></em>'s sudden quiz show in "Villi People"/"Jim is a Blind Cave Salamander", where neither the questions nor the answers make any sense (though, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">as suggested in the manual</a>, the "right" answer is usually the most nonsensical/wrong of them). In order to answer questions, you require mealworms (each question costs a mealworm, and you need 9 to join the show). Unlike other examples, you don't need to join the show to proceed in the level (but once you join it, you cannot leave until you spend all mealworms), and answering "correctly" only earns you either more mealworms or rewards you cannot use for the rest of the level.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a></em>: Re-recruiting Shinon. You have to talk to him with Rolf, and then defeat him with Ike. The latter part is logical enough given the sheer contempt Shinon shows Ike in basically every conversation they've ever had, but Rolf? Prior to this, the two have never had a single onscreen interaction. See, you're supposed to remember a seemingly throwaway line from 10 chapters ago where Rolf played coy about how he learned to use a bow, deduced that Shinon must have taught him because he also uses a bow, and that because of this Rolf holds a special place in Shinon's heart that can be used to return Shinon to the side of good, but only if Ike humiliates him in a duel first.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DinoCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DinoCrisis">Dino Crisis</a></em>'s door passwords each have to be deciphered from a Code Disc and a Digital Disc Key, with increasingly convoluted rules.

<ul><li> Using The Bible on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">Mom</a> will instantly kill her, unlocking the Halo (a pretty useful item). Nowhere in the game itself is this explained, and The Bible isn't an item you're likely to randomly use in a boss fight (it normally just grants temporary flight). At least the game justifies this, since a Bible <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">falls on Mom's head and kills her in a cutscene</span>, but no other item in the game has this kind of special rule.
</li><li> Unlocking <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Lost</span> in <em>Rebirth</em>. First, you have to kill yourself in a Sacrifice Room while holding the Missing Poster. This will display one of several unique death screens on your last will. Each death screen needs to be pieced together in the right order, then you need to kill yourself as each character in the right order with the methods listed. There are no hints that any of this will happen anywhere in the game. This was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask">deliberately impossible puzzle</a> that was supposed to be solved by the community as a whole, although the character and solution ended up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot">getting datamined</a> instead.
</li><li> <em>Afterbirth+</em> added an even straighter example. To unlock <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Forgotten</span>, you have to beat the boss on the first floor in under a minute. This will cause Mom to laugh. If you return to the spawn room, you'll see an odd shadow looming over it. Placing a bomb in the center of the room causes the handle of a shovel to fall down. While holding the shovel, Mom will <strong>constantly</strong> try to stomp on you, which will only cease for a single room when you activate the item. You need to carry this shovel all the way through the Mom fight and into Boss Rush, beat Boss Rush, then complete the shovel (mercifully making the feet stop). Then you need to take the shovel all the way to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Dark Room</a> and use it on an innocuous patch of dirt in a random room. Good luck even <em>starting</em> the puzzle.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>PRICE</em> has a few bizarre puzzles involving a doll that looks like the protagonist's sister. Examining the doll while having a separate item - a Hanged Man tarot card with an upside-down depiction of said sister - equipped gives the protagonist the completely-out-of-nowhere idea to hold the doll upside down, which causes the head to pop off and reveal a key. You're also required to mutilate the doll with a knife for no particular reason to find another key item.
</li><li> Common in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Grow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Grow">Grow</a></em> games where you need to place items in a certain orders to see them evolve and interact but they often interact in unexpected way and it's impossible to know in advance how each item will evolve the first time you play these games.

Perhaps the most evil ones came in the mid-1990s, where it was frequent for the bonus puzzle to be only <em>three</em> to seven letters long, with RSTLNE occasionally MIA entirely. Good luck trying to figure out that the three-letter "Person" they're looking for is GUY in only 10 seconds. Or in the 2010s, something else heavy on the obscure letters like JACK BE QUICK or ZIP UP YOUR JACKET.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Pyramid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Pyramid">Pyramid</a></em> franchise sometimes had this in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound">Bonus Round</a>, where the goal is to give a list of things that fit six given subjects in 60 seconds. No hand gestures, no prepositional phrases, just a list. While this may seem easy for something like "Types of Soup" (just list things like "chicken noodle" or "clam chowder", and so long as your partner says something with "soup" in it, you're good), try doing it with something like "Things That Are Enshrined".

By how the hosts explained it, it was implied that you had to jump through the circular disc to make it to the other side utilizing whatever they gave you that way to do it (trampoline, zip line, swing, etc). However, in reality, it ended up being hard to do so without using the shapes as an assist of some form.
<ul><li> Then again, in a moment of disbelief that left even the hosts stunned, Rico "Rolling Thunder" Curtis actually horizontally dived through the hole and landed on the platform with a tummy slide.

Steve Ryan would get in a good one on <em>Classic Concentration,</em> using a pitcher of ice water for "Onions Make Your Eyes Water".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Idiotest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Idiotest">Idiotest</a></em> is more or less <em>based</em> on these. Every question is presented as an image on a touchscreen, and contestants must touch the part of the picture that answers the question. Thing is, every question deliberately phrased in a way that makes the most obvious answer incorrect, and the right answer something else entirely. For example, the show might say "Touch the thing that always lets you see through walls", and include pictures of X-ray glasses, infrared cameras, and such. The correct answer? The <em>window</em> that looks like it's part of the background.
</li><li> The UK gameshow <em>3-2-1</em> was notorious for this: the contestants were given a series of props and riddles and had to decide if it led to a grand prize or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zonk">Zonk</a> — a dustbin.

In one example that was featured on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Room101" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Room101">Room 101</a></em>, the prop was a giant wishbone, and the clue was " "Take one that never changes, add a pub and a precious stone, bring them all up-to-date, and now, you're on your own." <em>Obviously</em> this refers to a package holiday to Istanbul (because the wishbone comes from a turkey, and the riddle indicates the modern name for Constant-Inn-Opal). The contestants seemed no wiser once Ted Rogers explained it, and who could blame them?

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> episode "Time Sandwich" has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster">Magic Man</a> steal Jake's sandwich and will only give it back if he gets past his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill">time-slowing</a> force field by solving his riddle which is, "When your face turns 7:20, when green leaves turn brown, the only way forward is down. Then you'll see, the wetter, the better." What does he mean? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He meant that Jake has to be sad to be able to move normally. The arms of a clock at 7:20 resembles a frown, brown leaves stands for autumn which is associated with melancholy, moving forward by having a "down" attitude, and wetter as in wet with tears.</span> While the riddle makes sense with the answer in mind, it fits this trope.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jake:</strong> That's not a riddle! That's wordplay at best! <br/><strong>Magic Man:</strong> You try to come up with something on the spot!
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> has a series of these when Dipper and Mabel try to track down the secrets of the founder of the town. However, his way of thinking is so strange that Dipper's logic can't figure out the clues, but Mabel's goofiness does. For example:
<ul><li> The note turns into a map if it's folded into a hat.
</li><li> The map leads to a picture that looks abstract, but is in fact, just upside down.
</li><li> The picture leads to a graveyard statue. Dipper tries to figure out what the statue is pointing at, while Mabel pushes a secret switch by pretending the angel is picking her nose.

<ul><li> Zen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Koan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Koan">Koans</a>. Consider: A monk asked Zhaozhou, "What is the meaning of the ancestral teacher's coming from the west?" Zhaozhou said, "The cypress tree in front of the hall". This is an actual koan from The Gateless Gate. The real trick is, that's not the answer. That's a <em>question.</em> The student is expected to learn and understand this exchange, and come up with the proper response.
</li><li> This math problem: Three friends are having coffee. They have 12 sugar cubes to share between them. Distribute the sugar cubes such that each person puts an odd number of sugar cubes in their cup of coffee. <br/>The solution: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Person A puts 1 sugar cube in their coffee, Person B also puts 1 sugar cube in their coffee, and Person C puts 10 sugar cubes in their coffee. While 10 is not an odd number mathematically, putting 10 sugar cubes in your coffee is <em>very</em> odd; the word "odd" in this case also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke">being used in the same sense</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSyntax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSyntax">"strange" or "unusual"</a>, and not just as in "leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by two".</span>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ARG/MITMysteryHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ARG/MITMysteryHunt">MIT Mystery Hunt</a> is practically <em>made</em> of these types of puzzles.
</li><li> Which weighs more - a pound of gold or a pound of feathers? <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note352us');"><sup>Answer </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note352us" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note352us');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The feathers weigh more, being measured in avoirdupois pounds that are somewhat heavier than troy pounds.</span> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4vp83');"><sup>Alternative answer </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4vp83" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4vp83');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The gold weighs more, because Archimedes' Force is density times the gravitational constant times volume of object, and the feathers would have a larger volume.</span> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note561wa');"><sup>Creatively-worded answer </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note561wa" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note561wa');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">You could interpret it as "How much of each material could you buy with the equivalent value of a pound sterling?", in which case the answer would almost certainly be the feathers.</span> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6ym8d');"><sup>Engineer's answer </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6ym8d" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6ym8d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Either the two weigh the same, or the initial statement is dangerously flawed. The premise states the existence of two units of differing materials, each weighing one unit. This unit has been identified as a pound, and <em>is</em>, by the information stated, identical for both. Using a single term to refer to two non-equivalent units would represent a failure to document critical information. Replace feathers and gold with safe structural loads, and this trick question becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatterOfLifeAndDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatterOfLifeAndDeath">grounds for serious criminal charges</a> in many nations.</span> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7v2vw');"><sup>Alternative Alternative Answer </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7v2vw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7v2vw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The feathers weigh more, because you also have to deal with the weight of what you did to all of those birds.</span>
<ul><li> Which weighs more; an ounce of feathers or an ounce of gold?<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note84vp7');"><sup>Answer </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note84vp7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note84vp7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The gold weighs more by about 2.75 g, since Troy ounces are 12 to a Troy pound instead of Avoirdupois' 16 to a pound.</span>
</li><li> Which weighs more; a pound or an ounce?<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9r5i1');"><sup>Answer </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9r5i1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9r5i1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">An ounce (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedlyObscureAnswer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedlyObscureAnswer">snow leopard</a>) is heavier than a pound (coin), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">obviously</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted often during job interviews as a means of testing for lateral thinking. As can be seen from the many equally valid answers to the gold/feather puzzle above, the interviewer is less interested in getting a "correct" answer and more interested in how the interviewee came about it. Sometimes the question is such that the "correct" answer is straightforward, but would be impossible for the candidate to know. An example given on the show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QI">QI</a> is "How many harpsichord repair experts are there in Britain?" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">For that example, <strong>nobody</strong> knows the answer. Even official census results don't have enough information since "harpsichord repair" isn't profitable enough to have as your primary occupation.</span>
</li><li> Cryptic crosswords. Instead of typical crossword puzzle clues, they will usually consist of two parts: a generic clue, and one that requires wordplay or some other contrivance to figure out. (For example: "Tragic arrangement in A-flat (5)": "Tragic" is the generic clue for the word, and "arrangement in A-flat" is the "cryptic" part, suggesting that the answer is an anagram of "A-flat"  in this case, the answer is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"fatal"</span>.) During World War II recruiters at Bletchley Park used a particularly difficult cryptic crossword to find potential codebreakers.
</li><li> The crossword puzzles featured in <em>Harper's</em> magazine not only use cryptic clues, they often <em>don't follow the normal crossword-puzzle structure.</em> Sometimes they're arranged in a spiral; sometimes they're a whole grid with a few bold lines to delineate where the black spaces ought to be...Suffice it to say that they're very, very devious, and anyone who's brave enough to try one had better learn to think <em>way</em> outside the box.
</li><li> The book <em>The Mother Tongue</em> notes that British crossword puzzles tend to be <strong>much</strong> harder than American ones, and often rely on rather complicated wordplay.
<ul><li> A particularly vexing one it lists has a five letter word, and the only clue is "Sweetheart could take Non-Commissioned Officer to dance". The answer is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "Flame"</span>. The explanation? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> NCO is short for Non-Commissioned Officer, another word for "sweetheart" is "flame" and the <em>flame</em>nco is a kind of dance.</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat">What?</a>
</li><li> A less ridiculous, but still really hard crossword mentioned in the same book: the word is three letters, and the only clue is "HIJKLMNO". The answer <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">H2O, as it's the letters of the alphabet from H to O.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The famous phrase "think outside the box". The "box" itself refers a classic puzzle, in which one is supposed to connect 9 dots in a box shape with 4 straight lines — which can be eased by going beyond the "box" formed by the dots. The puzzle itself dates back to 1914 at least, but it was popularized as a test of lateral thinking by management gurus in the '60s and '70s, who coined the phrase to refer to it.
