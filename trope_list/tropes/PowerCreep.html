This process leaves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason">old-content completely worthless</a>, save for a few exceptions and for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping">Cherry Tapping</a>.
</p><p>This makes sense, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">at least from a monetary point of view</a>. New-added-content requires people to actually buy it and use it, but why would they use their money to buy some obscure thing they don't know how to use (yet) if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Whoring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Whoring">they can keep on using</a> their awesome <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> by paying 5 mana?

</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The thing is that this gets out of hand really easy, particularly in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">Long Runner</a>. After four or five expansions, with the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Infinity+8 Swords that gives you 10 free mana</a>, there is little point in using the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason">Infinity+3 Sword that cost 2 mana</a>, and let's not talk about the lame <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">Infinity+1 Sword that cost 5 mana!</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny">Who'd ever use that, anyway?</a>)
</p><p>A Power Creep virtually always leads to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a>, with the most "conservative" players stating that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">the new unbalanced content is an insult to the original game</a> (which might be true or not, depending on the case). On the other hand, there will always be players who like these new add-ons, saying that it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">actually makes the game more fun to play</a>. Additionally, Power Creep can actually be a boon to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentPlay">Tournament Play</a>: Long, drawn-out games are harder to schedule since it's less easy to predict when everyone will finish on time. Thus, with Power Creep making games faster, tournaments become more accessible, less time-consuming, and easier to plan. (This is not an idle concern; the makers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> are on record as having to reject card designs because they would bring the match to a halt for five or ten minutes.)
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>As a general rule, though, Power Creep has a negative connotation. The reason behind it is that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw">while there may be some few exceptions</a>, it usually shows that the producers were unable to come up with something creative, and instead resorted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBalance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBalance">repeating themselves, just with bigger numbers</a>. Power Creep also tends to lead a game beyond its pre-defined limits, with one of two results: it will becomes a competition <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">of mindless speed</a>, or of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">predictable slow strategies</a>.
</p><p>The one time Power Creep can be positive is when it is used on something that was already a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a> to begin with. The two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HearthstoneHeroesOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HearthstoneHeroesOfWarcraft">Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft</a></em> cards in the page image are actually an example of this. The Ice Rager is "strictly better" (as <em>Magic</em> players put it) to the Magma Rager, having two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a> instead of one and being identical in all other respects (3 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Mana</a> to cast, 5 attack); if you have access to both, there is <em>never</em> a reason to play Magma Rager instead of Ice Rager. Having said that, there was also never a reason to play the Magma Rager in the first place, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy">it's an awful card</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0yuek');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0yuek" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0yuek');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In <em>Hearthstone</em>, you have 1 Mana on your first turn, 2 on your second, 3 on your third, etc until maxing out at 10. This rule can be broken, but only with difficulty. So, for most players, a card that costs 3 Mana, like Magma Rager, can only be played on turn 3. The problem is that it's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>... and cards with 1 Attack, capable of killing it, typically only cost 1 Mana. If you spend 3 Mana putting a threat on the table and your opponent destroys it at the cost of 1 Mana, then, all other things being equal, your opponent came out ahead. So, in practice, the only thing the Magma Rager does is waste 2 Mana. The Ice Rager, being a waste of only <em>1</em> Mana, is marginally better; but it also raises the question of whether wasting Mana <em>at all</em> is really the best way to play.</span>) Additionally, releasing a (more) playable version of it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshades">lampshades</a> the fact that you released junk in the first place.

</li><li> Figurines from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/MonsterInMyPocket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/MonsterInMyPocket">Monster in My Pocket</a></em> originally had a value between five and twenty five, but by the time the fourth set was out these had ballooned into the triple digits.
</li><li> Perfect monsters were what everyone wanted in the original <em>Digimon</em> V-pets. The pendulums added Ultimate monsters, which were better than the supposedly "perfect" ones. All Pendulum monsters registered as the highest-power Perfects when facing an older model (or the Digivice, which also registered as a Perfect against older models, making it competitively unviable), in an effort to push out the originals from the competitive scene. These Ultimates gained better stats over time. Later editions added Super Ultimate monsters, which were superior to the supposedly "ultimate" ones.
</li><li> The <em>MicroStars</em> series - a set of collectable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Football" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Football">Football</a> player figurines that could be used in a tabletop football game, suffered badly from this. When the first series of players were released, Gold-base players (the strongest and rarest) would have their five stats total around 50-60 with no stat being higher than maybe 15. By the time the figures stopped being sold in shops, Gold-base players could have stats of 25 across the board...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">and then there were</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">the new Black-base players</a> who were <em>even stronger</em> (and rarer).

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Tabletop Games (Not Card Games) </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> is a prime example due to the setting's moving timeline. The series originally started with a baseline of weaponry and equipment utilized by the Inner Sphere during 3025. As the years advance, lighter and more effective technology from the fallen Star League is gradually (re-)introduced, tremendously shifting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame">Metagame</a> in favor of them. There was a stretch of years when almost every new BattleMech featured at least one of the following: CASE, Double Heat Sinks, ER PPC's, Extralight Engines, and Gauss Rifles. Everything is completely turned on its side after an invasion by the Clans, who possess a slew of super advance technology and battlefield tactics never seen before. The Jihad introduces even more changes to the status quo: superheavy 'Mechs, DropShips that can destroy WarShips, cybernetic MechWarriors, and various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomsdayDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomsdayDevice">Doomsday Device</a> weaponry (up to and including a planet killer mass driver). The ongoing Dark Ages is sure to bring more changes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> 3.5:
<ul><li> In terms of overall design, it both played this straight and inverted it, in that the playerbase generally regards its initial material as containing the strongest classes <em>and</em> the weakest classes in the game. This was because the designers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBalance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBalance">really hadn't figured out how to balance the new system yet</a>, and conversely ended up with some classes being hilariously broken because they could abuse its mechanics, and others being utterly underpowered because the designers overestimated how good their abilities were. As a result, most classes to follow by the midpoint of the game tended towards the middle - for instance, the warmage and warlock are a lot weaker than the wizard but fill a similar role, while the duskblade and psychic warrior are a lot stronger than the fighter. A party of a binder, a dread necromancer, and a warblade would follow about the same party roles as the classic cleric-wizard-fighter trio, but be a lot closer in power.
</li><li> It's played completely straight with spells and feats, though, as a lot of sourcebooks would release new ones that broke one or more limitations. Compare Polar Ray (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Evocation,</a> 8th-level, single target, does 1d6 cold damage per level, offers Spell Resistance) to Orb of Frost (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll">Conjuration,</a> 4th-level, single target, does 1d6 cold damage per level and target must save or be blinded for a turn, doesn't offer Spell Resistance). This is a major reason for why casters are seen as broken, since it's easier for them to grab all the nasty tricks they can do in sourcebooks.
</li><li> Early on in the game, many casting-based prestige classes had a stunted progression, either not advancing spells or only advancing them every other level. Since very few things to a caster are worth losing their spells, most of the later ones provided either full advancement and incidental features, or full advancement barring one or two levels in exchange for <em>really</em> good features.
</li><li> An odd microcosm of the gradual "this isn't actually broken" realization can be seen with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon">Breath Weapons</a>. Initially, it was restricted for player use to either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">half-dragons</a> or the dragon disciple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass">Prestige Class</a>, maxed out at 6d8 damage, and could only be used once per day. Later on, there was the dragon shaman, which obtained a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon">Breath Weapon</a> at 4th level that did a maximum of 10d6 damage, but had a recharge time of 1d4 rounds. By the end of the game's lifespan, there was the dragonfire adept, whose <em>standard attack</em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon">Breath Weapon</a> that does a maximum of 9d6 damage, comes online at 1st level, and can be used every turn, and most of their abilities focus on ramping it up even further. Coincidentally, it's considered the only one of the above to be worth the effort.
</li><li> Another infamous one is the hexblade and duskblade - one which came out early on, the other a few years afterward. Both were designed to fill the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a> role, but the designers were apparently very tentative about a character who could do magic <em>and</em> fight in melee - the result being the hexblade, a class that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">kinda sucked at both.</a> When one compares the two classes, the duskblade comes out ahead in almost every way - better armor and saves, spells are gained earlier, stay at full caster level, and can be used more often, spell list includes 5th-level spells while the hexblade is stuck with 4th, and instead of the unimpressive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">Hexblade's Curse</a>, they have the highly-damaging <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullContactMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullContactMagic">Arcane Channeling.</a>
</li><li> This is a major reason for why <em>Tome of Battle</em> martial adepts tend to be controversial, as the crusader, swordsage, and warblade are generally seen as better in every way compared to the paladin, monk, and fighter, respectively. Even outside of their stronger chassis and abilities, they boast access to the maneuver and stance system, which grants them a host of versatile and powerful combat tricks that the earlier classes couldn't dream of. The thing is, the paladin, monk, and fighter were generally regarded as the <em>worst</em> of the core classes, so many players just saw it as a way to play out those archetypes without being useless. This creates arguments as to whether the core classes were truly beyond saving such that they needed to be effectively replaced, and whether the martial adepts are refreshingly balanced, overpowered, or even underpowered.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> suffers from this trope in at least two ways: one specific and the other generalized. The latter is thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards">Linear Warriors, Quadratic Wizards</a>. Newer material for melee classes does not match the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> combinations spell casting classes are capable of, which is often summed up by jaded pro-melee members of the community as, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">fighters can't have nice things</a>." The argument is that each new book leaves melee classes farther behind the already impressive spellcaster power curve. This is especially noticeable with certain official Paizo adventures, as the "final boss" to a high level campaign is either a full caster or has inherent abilities that negate spells to keep up with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame">Metagame</a>. A more direct example is the <em>Pathfinder Unchained</em> rule book, that offers revisions to making melee classes vastly more powerful than their vanilla original versions (via the new addition of Combat Feats), to help mitigate the perceived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards">Linear Warriors, Quadratic Wizards</a> problem.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>:
<ul><li> This is usually a problem with any codex that hasn't seen an update in a long time. The Dark Eldar and Necron codexes were infamous for this for a long time, as they were the oldest codexes not to be updated (the Dark Eldar had, at one point, gone 10 years without an update. That's almost 3 whole editions) and the Bretonnia book suffered from this as well (Their old perk was being able to field a full-cavalry army with a special regiment formation, but they changed to a unique regiment formation that, due to the new rules, doesn't actually do much for them and can actually be a handicap).
</li><li> A curious case of this happened with the Dark Angels and Black Templar 4th edition codexes. The Dark Angels, at the time, was part of a new wave of Space Marines; the cost of transports were reduced and they were given the Combat Squad rules as well as Characters who could change the force organization. This later all became moot when the standard Space Marine Codex got most of these (except for the all-Terminator army) and became completely moot when the Space Wolves gained Logan Grimnar (who could make all-Terminator armies). Black Templars, meanwhile, became the only Space Marine Codex to not have access to any of these perks during the duration of 5th edition. When 6th Edition hit, their codex instead got <em>dropped</em> and merged into the standard Space Marine codex.
</li><li> The scope of the game also has drastically changed. In 2nd Edition, an Eldar Guardian is suppose to be considered heavily armored and Fast, as they possessed a 5+ armor while still being able to run. In 3rd edition, the swarm-unit Termagants cost 8 points and needed upgrades, but was still classed as a swarm creature. In the current meta, a model costing 8-10 points had to have either a fantastic gun, decent armor, high toughness, or some combination thereof. The Termagant, meanwhile, was reduced to half the points without reduction in any of its combat abilities, but despite that it's now considered one of the least competitive units unless paired with its support unit the Tervigon. Similarly, Eldar Guardians are considered to have paper-thin armor, and their running ability has become near-universal (Eldar just run faster).
</li><li> The advent of D-Weapons, Superheavy vehicles and Gargantuan Creatures. All of these introduced new rules on top of existing rules, because they were suppose to be so powerful that the current statistic system couldn't accurately represent them without exceptions. D-Weapons in particular, as they were supposed to be literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> as the Strength value only goes <em>up to 10</em>. In 7th edition, they were all incorporated into the <em>base rulebook</em>, whereas previously they were exclusive to the Apocalypse supplement.
</li><li> In prior editions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Imperial Knights</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard">Adeptus Custodes</a> were only available as rare supplements to other Imperial forces, in 8th edition they became their own factions.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>:
<ul><li> Happens so frequently that the term "<a class="urllink" href="http://wiki.mtgsalvation.com/Strictly_better">strictly better<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" has entered the <em>Magic</em> lexicon to describe the phenomenon. Card A is "strictly better" than Card B when they are identical in most parameters, and in the ones where they're different Card A has a clear advantage, meaning that Card A is preferable to Card B in almost all situations. Specific example: <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=209">Lightning Bolt<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> costs 1 mana and deals 3 damage, where <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=5143">Shock<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> does only 2. (Note that this comparison is <em>not</em> an example of Power Creep: Shock is actually a deliberate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">nerf</a> to Lightning Bolt.) Such cards often exist in newer sets for limited formats (where players open packs of cards and build decks out of just those cards) for the sake of balancing restricted card pools. An incomplete list of cards that fit the "strictly better" comparison can be viewed <a class="urllink" href="http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Strictly_better">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. In total fairness, the game is over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">20 years</a> and 20,000+ cards old, which simply suggests that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a> is inevitable on some level, not to mention the fact that the most powerful cards in the game came with its very first set.
</li><li> There is also <em>deliberate</em> creep on the part of Wizards. The overall pattern has been creatures growing in strength while spells get weaker. When the game first came out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards">Linear Warriors, Quadratic Wizards</a> was in full effect. The infamous <a class="urllink" href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/power-nine-2003-10-15">Power Nine<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> were early cards considered to be the most powerful effects in the game (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">despite all but one of them being fairly boring in effect</a>). Six of them are mana sources while the other three are all spells, with no creatures appearing. Meanwhile, <a class="urllink" href="http://magiccards.info/al/en/103.html">Force Of Nature<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was originally the biggest creature in the game, an 8/8 (for 6 mana) that you need to keep paying mana to in order to keep alive. Nowadays, <a class="urllink" href="http://magiccards.info/zen/en/187.html">Terra Stomper<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> - a "strictly better" version with a more flexible casting cost, the upkeep drawback removed, and a small perk added - is too weak to play in competition. Additionally, compare <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220176">Serra Angel<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a creature that was at one point removed from the core set for being too powerful, to <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=205077">Baneslayer Angel<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which lacks one of Serra Angel's traits (Vigilance) but replaces it with a metric crap-ton of other stuff. Ironically, creatures were never really underpowered; even creatures that were relatively garbage, like Ironclaw Orcs, have appeared in tournament-winning decks, and the periods of time when creatureless decks could win tournaments were brief and rare. WotC has simply realized that absurdly powerful creatures are a reliable way to squeeze money out of certain types of players.
</li><li> Wizards has also identified <em>complexity</em> creep as an issue. The rules needed to deal with thousands of different cards make for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorStopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorStopper">imposing document</a>. The spiraling increases in complexity put the game at risk of being impossible for any potential customer to understand. To combat this, they created the Type 2 (or Standard) format, which is theoretically immune to both power creep and complexity creep as only the last two years of cards are allowed, so that power creep/seep relative to older cards doesn't matter.
</li><li> Wizards also takes measures to avoid the level of power creep that other CCGs suffer by temporarily increasing the power of one type of effect, but scaling it back later to focus on another aspect.
</li><li> Finally, it should be pointed out that "strictly better" cards almost always have another downside: they're (almost always) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper">strictly more expensive</a>, especially in cases like Lightning Bolt vs Shock. How much more? In this case, <em>ten times more</em> (25¢ vs $2.50). And let's not even <em>talk</em> about the value difference between the aforementioned Serra and Baneslayer Angels.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ana2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ana2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ana2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Serra Angel has been printed with tons of different sets of cards, including the original Alpha set, oftentimes as an uncommon, which you are guaranteed to get three of in every 15-card "booster pack" you buy. Baneslayer Angel is a <em>Mythic</em> Rare, which replaces the Rare in about one of every <em>eight</em> booster packs, and has been printed in only two sets.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon">Pokémon Trading Card Game</a></em> similarly raises the bar for each generation. In the 1st generation, Stage 2 Pokémon (Pokémon who have evolved twice, like Charizard) were lucky to have 120 HP. In the 5th generation, Basic Pokémon (Pokémon who don't evolve or haven't evolved) get published with this much HP or more in every set, with evolved Pokémon approaching 200 HP. Attacks have since increased in damage and Energy costs too. It has gotten to where <a class="urllink" href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Venusaur_%28Base_Set_15%29">Base Set Venusaur's<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> "Energy Trans," which allows free transfer of Energy between Pokémon, was a near <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> in the card game's earliest days but the later <a class="urllink" href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Meganium_%28HeartGold_%26_SoulSilver_109%29">Meganium Prime<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from <em>HeartGold/SoulSilver</em>, which has the same power, was quickly brushed aside for quicker and more powerful cards.
<ul><li> Inverted with Trainer Cards, which seem to get progressively worse as time goes on. In the original Base Set, you had a lot of draw power by using four copies each of Professor Oak, Bill, Computer Search, and Item Finder. Nowadays, cards with those effects are printed only as Supporter cards (you can only use them once per turn) or ACE SPEC cards (you can only have one in your deck), thus drastically limiting their potential.
</li><li> The current record holder for most HP is Magikarp &amp; Wailord GX, with an astounding 300 HP as, mechanically, a <em>Basic</em> Pokémon. For comparison, M Charizard EX, the current record holder for most damage in one attack, can still knock it out in one hit, with Crimson Dive, which does 300 damage.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> suffers heavily from Power Creep corresponding with the release of each new anime. The idea is that, to make the new game mechanics and wealth of new cards playable, they have to be stronger than what's already available. Most of the old cards that are still used tend to be "staples". This is sometimes subverted through the Forbidden &amp; Limited List which attempts to balance the game out and can sometimes make older cards useful again.
<ul><li> The addition of new ways to Special Summon monsters (specifically, Synchro and Xyz) represent a major form of Power Creep. In the old days of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, certain Special Summons (Fusions and Ritual monsters) required their own cards for set-up (such as Polymerization, Fusion Material monsters, or the Ritual Magic Card), and generally could not be as easily deployed. The metagame tended to favor powerful single-Tribute monsters at highest (such as Summoned Skull). Nowadays, the right deck set-up can swarm the field with Special Summoned level 7 or 8 monsters.
</li><li> A common criticism of the game is that, unlike <em>Pokémon</em> and <em>Magic the Gathering</em>, <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> lacks any "Standard" format - a format that would only allow players to use cards from the last "n" sets. This has caused a constantly-fluctuating and extensive banned list, as well as older cards completely breaking the new Summon types.
<ul><li> The lack of 'standard' format is justified due to Konami periodically assessing the banlist, removing some older cards from it, since the meta game has changed. For example, in 2015, Raigeki (a spell with the effect to wipe out all opponent's monsters on the field without cost) was removed from the banned list, because most modern decks can handle getting hit by one due to easiness of special summoning in the meta-game than compared to the past.
</li></ul></li><li> And then there is the "Traditional" format that is used in some unofficial tournaments, which does not operate under the banned list. The thing is entirely dominated by FTK decks and old ones have about just as much chance to win as new ones. You could say that this format perfectly determines how broken some cards actually are.
</li><li> Back in the heyday of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning was considered completely broken: being able to summon itself by banishing 1 light and 1 dark monster from the graveyard, thus putting a 3000 atk monster onto the field who can then either banish 1 monster in play or attack twice (but not both). This required: 1) at least 1 Dark and 1 Light Monster in your graveyard, 2) BLS-EOTD in your Hand. This meant that you had to have: 1)around 8+ Light monsters and around 8+ Dark Monsters in your deck so as to consistently draw them, 2) discard or sac outlets to get them into the graveyard, 3)some way to reliably draw your ONE BLS-EOTB, because you were only allowed to have 1. Cut to modern times: Number S39 - Utopia The Lightning can be summoned by simply having <em>any</em> two level 4 monsters in play to summon Utopia from your Extra Deck, who then by himself summons Utopia the Lightning from the Extra Deck. Utopia the Lightning doesn't allow <em>any</em> cards or effects to be activated during combat (so no flip effects, no mirror force, magical cylinders, etc.), and can increase his attack from 2500 to 5000 by dropping two Xyz Material Monsters when either attacking or defending. Many <em>many</em> level 4 monsters self-summon or summon a buddy directly from the deck or hand, so having even 1 monster in your hand is almost guaranteed to get out UTL immediately, because you <em>always</em> have access to every card in your Extra Deck.
</li><li> The game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a> is so infamous, these days, it's become somewhat of a poster boy for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a> in tabletop games. The most infamous example from the ARC-V era has to be Zoodiacs, an archetype designed to be so powerful that <em><a class="urllink" href="https://kensir096.blogspot.sg/2017/01/this-is-what-happens-when-you-play-too.html">many Japanese card shops refused to have them legal in their tournaments out of protest<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>. When Zoodiacs were released, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc_3A2YaK1g">the OCG metagame consisted of nothing else than Zoodiac decks and Zoodiac hybrid decks<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This example has become so infamous that many are using it as an example of how <em>not</em> to design an archetype for a cardgame, and why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a> in games can be a very, very bad thing.
</li><li> Oddly inverted with Spells and Traps. Many of those from the beginning of the series had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InverseLawOfComplexityToPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InverseLawOfComplexityToPower">simple, yet powerful effects</a> like Monster Reborn (Special Summon any monster from either Graveyard at no cost), Pot of Greed, (draw 2 cards at no costs), Raigeki (destroy all your opponents monsters at no cost), and Change of Heart (take control of any monster your opponent controls at no cost). Later cards would have a cost and/or be less efficient. In particular, Mystical Space Typhoon stayed in use for over a decade, only finally falling out of use when cards like Twin Twisters and Galaxy Cyclone showed up (and even they're more sidegrades than upgrades; it's just that said sidegrades happen to be very favorable in the modern game)
</li></ul></li><li> One of the (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">many</a>) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> trading card games saw this to an extreme degree with its very first expansion. The base set was overall pretty balanced - the more powerful characters had limitations, and sub-par combat cards in the set served as a balancing factor for specialized "style decks" due to the restricted card selection of those decks. Then the first expansion came out, and introduced characters with power levels several times those of the base sets cards, and combat cards that were flat-out better than previous cards with no trade-offs. The second expansion set introduced new versions of the basic characters with power levels so much higher as to make the original version worthless. And it went on from there. While this does follow the course of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>'s story (which is essentially Power Creep manifest), it represents a complete failure of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>.
</li><li> As new cards were introduced to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hearthstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hearthstone">Hearthstone</a></em>, Power Creep inevitably followed. For example, when released Piloted Shredder was so much more powerful than any existing four mana minion that in most cases it became the only card worth playing at that cost. The following expansion had to include several cards designed specifically to counter it because the card had become so dominant. <em>Extra Credits</em> discusses this specific case in detail <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3b3hDvRjJA">here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> Players actually called this with two cards introduced in <em>The Grand Tournament</em> expansion: Evil Heckler is exactly the same as Booty Bay Bodyguard (A 5-Mana 5/4 minion with Taunt), but costs 1 Mana less, and Ice Rager marginally beats out the infamously bad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Magma Rager</a> in usefulness by the merit of having <em>a single point of Health more</em> than Magma Rager (as a 5/2, as opposed to a 5/1). This was acknowledged by Blizzard, and even parodied (see below). However, as pointed out by <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3b3hDvRjJA">Extra Credits<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Neither Magma Rager <em>nor</em> Booty Bay Bodyguard ever saw use except as throwaways by new players who didn't have anything better, and even then, they were probably ditched after two games tops; as such, Ice Rager and Evil Heckler aren't strictly examples of power creep since they're straight upgrades to cards that might as well not exist to begin with and themselves saw next to no play.
</li><li> Blizzard seems to be addressing the Power Creep issue with the introduction of Standard format, which forbids older expansions from being used. Coincidentally, the two expansions that are first being rotated out of the format (<em>Curse of Naxxramas</em> and <em>Goblins vs. Gnomes</em>) contains many of the most dominant cards in the game since. It also ensures that even new and possibly overpowered cards will eventually get cycled out, or at least possibly receive indirect nerfs by removing older cards that had strong synergy with newer ones. For example, Mysterious Challenger, the single-most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy">notorious</a> card at the moment, got less powerful with the removal of Avenge and Muster for Battle. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2iz5z');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2iz5z" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2iz5z');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Avenge, when combined with Noble Sacrifice, allowed you to block a hit with a 2/1 minion, which would automatically trigger Avenge to give a random minion +3/+2. Combine that with Muster for Battle to summon 3 1/1s and Competitive Spirit and you can have either 3 2/2s and a 10/9 or a 7/7, a 5/4, and two 2/2s on the next turn, giving you substantial board control as long as the opponent didn't have <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AoE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AoE">Ao E</a> removal at hand. Muster for Battle's comparative replacement, Stand Against Darkness, costs one too much mana to play in one turn normally.</span>
</li><li> Parodied in <em>Whispers of the Old Gods</em> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SdrawkcabName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SdrawkcabName">Am'gam</a> Rager. As the name implies, it's the aforementioned Magma Rager in reverse, and its flavor text is "<em>peerc rewop</em>". The joke is that a 1/5 is for three mana is about as bad as a 5/1.
</li><li> A general issue with the Basic/Classic Sets is that they heavily overvalued effects like restoring health and Taunt while undervaluing effects like gaining attack and Charge. Later expansions have power creeped heavily to give effects their proper cost, to the complaints of almost no one... though a lot of players would enjoy the original cards being adjusted to match instead of simply being replaced. A commonly-touted example is Silverback Patriarch, a 3-cost 1/4 Beast with Taunt who even at the time was criminally understatted (basically paying 2 mana for 1 attack when compared to the 0/4 Shieldbearer, and even in the 3-mana slot, the 3/3 Ironfur Grizzly beat it out by 1 stat point total). Silverback Patriarch is so infamously bad, the Hearthstone wiki <a class="urllink" href="https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Cards_better_than_Silverback_Patriarch">has a page<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> cataloging every card superior to it.
</li><li> There's a minor joke about this. Back in the day, the 4 mana 3/5 statline would net you <a class="urllink" href="https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Sen%27jin_Shieldmasta">one word: Taunt<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and people used it all the time. Nowadays it <a class="urllink" href="https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Diseased_Vulture">takes a paragraph and fills your board with minions<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and people are <em>maybe</em> considering using it.
</li><li> To put the game's power creep in perspective: Chillwind Yeti and Boulderfist Ogre, a 4-mana 4/5 and 6-mana 6/7 respectively, were considered the gold standard of stat efficiency in the early days of the game. Any minion with their mana costs that have actual effects would have worse stats in exchange... for a while. It wasn't long before Chillwind Yeti was power-creeped by cards that share the 4-mana 4/5 statline but also have actual effects, and Boulderfist Ogre eventually followed.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CardfightVanguard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CardfightVanguard">Cardfight!! Vanguard</a></em>, to see pure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a> in action, just look at how mechanics have progressed - at first, we had normal grade 3 units. Then, we got Limit Break and Break Rides, the former of which commonly added 5000 power to the vanguard, and the latter adding 10000. Legion kept the roughly-10000 power increase but eased up the activation conditions, as well as giving it to the vanguard for the entire time they are in Legion, not just the Break Ride turn. Now we have Striding, which adds <em>15000</em> power to the vanguard's attacking power, and it's fairly difficult to not be able to Stride at all. However the next mechanic works, it's a safe bet that it will add 20000 power to your vanguard.
<ul><li> It's present on the other end of the scale as well; first, every card was either 5000 shield or 10000 shield. Slowly, more units came out that could go from 5000 to 10000 shield, as well as being passable units in their own right (if not amazing). The G-era gave most clans a card which was worth 15000 shield once a condition was met. Now, we get G-guardians, which are always the full 15000 shield, as well as adding all sorts of useful abilities (including gaining even more shield) on top.
<ul><li> Perfect shields/null guards/complete shields have had their own style of creep. The base units were able to stop any attack by discarding a card. Newer versions only did it for your vanguard (i.e. the only unit that usually gets attacked with huge enough numbers to warrant a perfect shield anyway), but gave you a counterblast back if there was another copy of itself in the drop. Now, keyword perfect shields frequently lose the reflip ability, but give you some way to bounce back to the hand from the field, letting you use it as an actual unit without sacrificing the ability to defend from high-power attacks at all.
</li></ul></li><li> Costs in general for abilities also lower over time. What once cost <a class="urllink" href="http://cardfight.wikia.com/wiki/Dragonic_Kaiser_Vermillion">three counterblast<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> now is <a class="urllink" href="http://cardfight.wikia.com/wiki/Dragonic_Kaiser_Crimson">free with new support<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, as well as adding 10000 power on top to make sure the front row gets pummelled... And <em>even that</em> wasn't even good enough to play, on release.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shadowverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shadowverse">Shadowverse</a></em> has its fair share of Power Creep like any other card game, in not just general card quality improvements, but also with high-cost cards having exponentially stronger game-ending effects.
<ul><li> Take a look at <a class="urllink" href="https://shadowverse-portal.com/card/101441010">Fafnir<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from the original set: It's a sizeable 8/10 Dragoncraft follower for 9 Play Points and deals 2 damage to every other follower to clear out multiple small or dying followers. Now compare that to <a class="urllink" href="https://shadowverse-portal.com/card/103041010">Bahamut<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who costs 1 more Play Point, is a 9/9, is Neutral, and completely destroys every other follower, regardless of their defense. Now which of these would you include in your deck?
</li><li> Compare <a class="urllink" href="https://shadowverse-portal.com/card/101411020">Maelstrom Dragon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a 2pp 2/1 which gains Storm if played during Overflow, with <a class="urllink" href="https://shadowverse-portal.com/card/104411030">Dragoon Scyther<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which only costs 1pp more, has 1 extra defense, gains Storm like her predecessor, but also packs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">Bane</a> that lets her pick off enemy powerhouses. Naturally the latter is used much more.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://shadowverse-portal.com/card/101321020">Spectral Wizard<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://shadowverse-portal.com/card/106311030">Magic Owl<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> both do the same thing — Spellboost cards in hand twice on evolution. Magic Owl, however, has entirely eclipsed Spectral Wizard, being 1pp cheaper and being 1 attack stronger after evolution, on top of being a Bronze card to add insult to injury.
</li><li> If you want to look at the most tragic case of power creep, then look no further than <a class="urllink" href="https://shadowverse-portal.com/card/101741010">Skullfane<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. A 7-cost 4/4 follower is terrible on its own, but while its effect of destroying all amulets might sound good on paper, but it's impractical to have multiple worthwhile follower-summoning amulets to set up before playing Skullfane (not to mention the best you can get out of an amulet was a 6/6 follower back then), not to mention it also destroys any amulets without Countdown that aren't meant to be destroyed. Two expansions later, <a class="urllink" href="https://shadowverse-portal.com/card/103741010">Eidolon of Madness<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is added to the game, which while it requires evolving for an instant effect, it does what Skullfane does but does it every end of turn as long as it's alive. When that wasn't good enough, two more expansions later, <a class="urllink" href="https://shadowverse-portal.com/card/106741020">Heresy's Avatar<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> gets added, which does the same thing but is <em>permanent</em> after it's destroyed, and it also affects only your Countdown amulets — the only ones worth destroying. Oh, and you can even combo it with <a class="urllink" href="https://shadowverse-portal.com/card/106041020">Zodiac Demon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to kill it off instantly. With that many layers of Power Creep, Skullfane has gone from a bad legendary to one of the worst cards in the game.
</li><li> The Power Creep seeped into design philosophy starting from the <em>Rise of Bahamut</em> card set, and came to a head in <em>Tempest of the Gods</em> and <em>Wonderland Dreams</em>, where the blatantly overpowered cards had a massive hand in creating the most dominant decks of their time which pushed out everything else. It was so bad that as of 2018, Cygames has nerfed at least <strong>twelve</strong> cards each from both the <em>Tempest</em> and <em>Wonderland</em> expansions to keep things in check, and even then some of the more dominant decks in the Rotation format hinged on cards from those expansions that have managed to avoid getting nerfed. Their design philosophy has shifted away from blatant Power Creep, but it will take time for the powerhouses of the past to leave the Rotation format to give their new ideas the breathing space to grow.
</li><li> ...Except even after those sets rotated out, Power Creep continues to run rampant, only in a different way. Cygames prints less cards that are bloated in raw value (<a class="urllink" href="https://shadowverse-portal.com/card/110541010">usually<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), but because of their philosophies shifting towards archetypes and their continued insistence on believing games should not last more than 10 turns on average, Power Creep is now geared more towards utility and making win conditions better. Post-<em>Wonderland</em> Shadowverse is extremely tailored towards specific archetypes and full of cards with permanent leader effects, and keywords like Choose, Accelerate, and Invocation create more cards that are less "dead draws" and decks easier to sift through. Cygames also has a habit of printing the perfect <a class="urllink" href="https://shadowverse-portal.com/card/108733010">curve filler<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://shadowverse-portal.com/card/109541030">combo piece<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, or just way to deal <a class="urllink" href="https://shadowverse-portal.com/card/110331010">face damage effortlessly<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to underwhelming archetype one or half an expansion later and have it suddenly jump up a tier. Power Creep has also started to affect stats as well, with since <em>Omen of the Ten</em> the gold standard stats for 3-cost followers jumping up from 2/3 to 3/3 and way more cards with Evolve effects getting the full +2/+2.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder3');">    Video Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder3" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> This happens a lot in each <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em> game with each expansion pack. As new mechanics are added, older civilizations may not be able to perform the same play style as effectively, while new civilizations may have unique units, buildings, and abilities that seriously outclass those from the vanilla game.
<ul><li> In <em>Civ V</em>, America's unique ability, "Manifest Destiny", cuts the cost of buying tiles in half (and gives all land units +1 sight, a comparatively minor buff). Come the <em>Brave New World</em> expansion, you have the Shoshone's unique ability, "Great Expanse", which gives every newly-founded city eight free tiles and gives military units a combat bonus when fighting on friendly territory (i.e. on the home front). This thoroughly outclassed America's unique ability, which many fans felt should have been beefed up in <em>Brave New World</em> to make up for it. One of America's unique units, the Minuteman, did get a minor buff (it now generates Golden Age points from victories), but not enough to compensate.
</li><li> Also from <em>V</em>, the Aztecs did not get a rework in <em>Brave New World</em>. Before that, their unique ability, "Sacrificial Captives", giving them Culture for kills meant that they could be used to pursue a Cultural Victory (which involved accumulating culture points and using them to buy social policies), counterintuitive though it might seem. Under the Tourism system introduced by <em>Brave New World</em>, which heavily redesigned the Culture system, including Cultural Victories, that is no longer possible.
</li><li> The big one in <em>V</em>, though, is India. Their unique ability, "Population Growth", is the only one that carries a penalty: namely, it doubles unhappiness from the number of cities, with the fact that it halves unhappiness from total population (a very powerful buff) making up for it. It was crafted with the intention of building a very "tall" nation with a small handful of very densely-populated and built-up cities, which was optimal for a Cultural Victory in the vanilla game (more cities increases the culture cost of social policies). <em>Brave New World</em>, however, changed Cultural Victories such that a large empire is now preferable, precisely the sort of thing that India's unique ability pulls against. The result is that one of the best empires for a Culture Victory in the vanilla game and <em>Gods &amp; Kings</em> becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy">Tier-Induced Scrappy</a> in <em>Brave New World</em>.
</li><li> The fact that this trope was averted with Arabia and France in <em>V</em>, who both had their unique abilities completely redesigned for <em>Brave New World</em> to take advantage of the new systems in place (and in France's case, also got a new unique improvement to go with it), was especially stinging. Many fans felt that what was done with Arabia and France should've been a model for how to redesign other civs whose abilities were made redundant by new civs or changes to gameplay mechanics.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonFighterOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonFighterOnline">Dungeon Fighter Online</a></em> is pretty good on this matter but some of it still occurs mainly with higher caps making some of the lengthy quest for gear at a certain point useless to some new subclasses and class tweaks being quite strong but they don't remain that way for long. It's rumored that some of the recent tweaking (in regards to the game's raid content) in the Korean version threatens to invoke this on a massive scale.
</li><li> While not a multiplayer game, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors">Dynasty Warriors</a></em> franchise exhibits this greatly, due to having so many successive entries, with each entry adding more and more new playable characters. Newly added characters usually have more powerful and/or flashier movesets, while older characters are left in the dust.
<ul><li> This is painfully apparent in the 4th main installment of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors">Samurai Warriors</a>, where the returning characters are still using their old movesets from their first appearance, some as old as 10 years ago, while the new characters added in this entry have generally stronger and more effective movesets.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MusouStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MusouStars">Musou Stars</a> is a crossover game that puts new and old characters together, including some of the older characters from the above mentioned Samurai Warriors. It attempts to rectify this by adding new moves to the older characters' movesets and injecting various enhancements, such as new attack animations, larger hitboxes, and smoother movement.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elsword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elsword">Elsword</a></em> is pretty bad about this in both releasing overpowered new content and the nerfing of things, often resulting in an uneven level of power. Like the League of Legends example, people suspect the new classes are overpowered to cause people to buy class change items to change them. All the while they're very slow to really bring up older classes/characters up to speed to the newer ones. Tellingly, despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTitle">Character Title</a> game, players of Elsword -the first character on the roster- are vanishingly rare in the end-game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em> is fairly good on this track since the release of the Abyssea expansion, first raising the maximum player level from 75 to 99 and then providing equipment that "simulates" player levels well above 100 by equipping it (in the later Adoulin expansion). While previous expansions did provide increases in equipment, those were mostly marginal or situational, but newer equipment has escalated on the improvements to such a degree that, for example, the legendary "Pandemonium Warden" boss (which gained some notoriety outside the community) can now be beaten by a single player, and there seems to be no end in sight, with nearly monthly updates that add new equipment (compared to the previous policy of roughly two updates a year that mostly fixed bugs or other issues). The developers have attempted (and at times succeeded) in keeping older content up-to-date by creating copies of it with higher statistics and level requirements and consequently level-appropriate rewards. The game's population has continued to decrease on many servers, but whether that is because of a case of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a>" or <em>despite</em> the changes made by the developers is hard to say.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranblueFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranblueFantasy">Granblue Fantasy</a></em>: Many characters have become less useful over time not because of their raw stats, but because they don't offer the variety that new characters often bring. However, there's a number of rebalance patches that attempt to bring older characters up to a more current standard, though some older characters' kits are just too flawed to improve much.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em> has the "Item of the Month", purchasable in the cash shop (or with loads of in game money) which serve as the game's source of revenue. These items are usually the most powerful thing you could put in the 'slot' that it occupies, with several slots only being usable by these items. The items need to be worth purchasing for even old players, and so a small amount of this can certainly be seen as time goes on. However, a fair amount of the power creep owes to the very idea of what these items were allowed to do, as early items were just mildly buffed versions of existent items, or else just a bit more versatile or fun. Later items are much more powerful, in general, than early items because of a change in design philosophy to make these items much more unique, which usually translates in practice to more powerful.
<ul><li> The developers are somewhat keen on averting this, however, although the limited availability of these items doesn't help matters. Some particularly popular old items have been 're-released' in different forms. In some cases, they provide the same 'important' option as before, but with some minor differences. New players can more easily obtain the useful item, and old players (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">who are generally obsessed with gaining every advantage they can</a>) will find a way for the slight differences to give them a reason to use both. On the other hand, there have been instances where the new versions are almost complete upgrades, obviating the need for the old versions.
</li><li> Kingdom of Loathing, however, is for the most part a single player game. As such, it manages to avoid a lot of the problems generally caused by this trope. Players without a single Item of the Month can happily play the game, and still share quite a few strategies with those who own every single one, since the only real competition is indirect, and there's no need to worry about those who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">have been around longer and spent more money</a> ruining the fun of those who aren't willing to spend money themselves.
</li><li> Many of the boss drops in the expanded Sea quest are unambiguously better than anything that came before them. The Stick-Knife is one of the most ridiculous: its +200% Spell Damage property is equivalent to the highest-end magic staffs, but the Knife is <em>not</em> a magic staff, comes with additional powerful add-ons that staffs don't have, and can, unlike staffs, be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding">dual-wielded</a>.
</li><li> The game also has the unusual problem of "adventure creep." Its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiPoopSocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiPoopSocking">Anti Poop-Socking</a> mechanism limits the turns available per day, but there's no hard limit, and many items allow you to gain extra turns—rare or expensive ones tend to be more efficient. Some things directly increase the free chunk of turns you'll get the next day, or allow you to do certain things more times per day...as you'd expect, this leads to people spending more and more time on the game, and the developers aren't sure if this is a good thing or not.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends">League of Legends</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeToPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeToPlay">Free-to-Play</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiplayerOnlineBattleArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiplayerOnlineBattleArena">Multiplayer Online Battle Arena</a> that updates frequently, usually accompanied with new characters. Accusations of Power Creep are frequent, and its developers have made it clear they are intent on avoiding it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">Nerfs</a> regularly happen in updates — to the point that some players accuse the developer of releasing characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered">Purposely Overpowered</a> to cause <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin">players who like winning</a> to buy them with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Microtransactions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Microtransactions">Microtransactions</a>, and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">Nerf</a> them in the next patch to placate their fanbase after raking in cash for a few weeks. That being said, numerous characters have been dubbed <em>underpowered</em> on release as well. While power creep has <em>definitely</em> set in over the years, Riot does seem to be making an effort to keep it from getting out of hand, which is best evidenced by their tendency to nerf strong champs rather than buff weak ones (as an overabundance of buffs tends to lead to the game turning into a trigger-happy crowd control and burst-fest).
<ul><li> A particular example where the developers think they have failed to avoid the trope are many melee-range "fighter" characters being "overtuned". In a game where being melee-ranged potentially means up to five enemy players attacking you at once, while you can't hit more than one of them at a time in return, Riot have responded by making melee characters with sustained healing potential, movement-hampering crowd-control effects, high durability, good damage, and low cooldown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">Flash Step</a> abilities to quickly place them next to targets (compared to movement-speed-increasing abilities that still force the user to run up to targets and are countered by slowing effects). The problem is, this puts the onus back on the ranged characters, who have little chance to avoid being gap-closed without the help of allies, or having a Flash Step of their own to dodge with. In other words, the only obvious drawback to this new breed of melee characters is they are not ranged, especially when earlier examples of fighters tended to have some clear lack of one of these aspects. A sentiment among some of the game's players similarly believe "gap-closer/gapcloser"s as a concept is overused by newer characters, numerous popular characters have them, and this has caused a "mobility creep" in new releases. To be fair, a lot more of the mobility options are conditional or otherwise involve some amount of risk, which is better than the targeted blink gap closers or click-and-escape abilities that used to be far more numerous.
</li></ul></li><li> Power creep has taken form in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto: Online's</a></em> multiple years of content updates. Here are a few examples:
<ul><li> Car performance has been slowly escalating as the game has gone on, although with super cars the slowly part doesn't really apply. When the game was released, out of all the super cars released with the game, only the Adder is still technically the best in its given skill set and it's not by much. Cars like the Entity and Zentorno (which itself made several super cars obsolete when it was introduced) were surpassed by newer DLC cars like the Osiris and T20. After these cars came the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll">X80 proto</a> which functionally dethroned the Adder as the fastest car in the game while also having incredible acceleration and handling. <em>After that</em> came the cunning stunts cars, which had lower speed and or acceleration but <em>even better</em> handling than the X80.
</li><li> Cars' abilities also suffer from this. The basic cars the game had from the start are your typical get-you-from-point-A-to-point-B vehicles, but slowly cars were introduced that had mounted guns, bulletproof and later explosion-proof plating, and even <em>homing rocket launchers</em>.
<ul><li> One notable example is with the Ruiner 2000, a car that has a jump-and-glide ability that gives you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameFlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameFlight">Video Game Flight</a>. The following update had a DeLorean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> that just straight up gave you the ability to fly.
</li></ul></li><li> Better and better ways to make money have come out as the game has progressed. First grinding contact missions were the only real way to make the big bucks without resorting to Shark cards. Then heists were finally released giving the players access to huge payouts and shattering the standard set by contact missions. Then CEO work added to the game which boasted even greater money-making in the same amount of time at the cost of being much riskier due to both investment in product and by virtue of taking place in free roam lobbies. Then Motorcycle club businesses were released which don't offer quite the same money for total time but require a far less active role and don't require the player to risk investment in product. <em>After that</em> Import Exporting was introduced with an even safer and faster way to make money than the MC businesses. And after the July 2018 After Hours update, you have the nightclub, the first business that allows you to have a truly passive method of making money, needing only to do a mission every half hour to maintain nightclub popularity.
</li></ul></li><li> There have been complaints that the co-op portion of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> is feeling the effects of this, with accusations that each expansion's new weapons and character classes are deliberately overpowered compared to the vanilla ones in order to encourage spending more in-game credits/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">Microsoft Points</a> on equipment packs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Pokémon stat spreads slowly became more specialized as time went on. Those that could be seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruisers</a> in <em>Red and Blue</em> became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jacks-Of-All-Stats</a> as more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing">Min-Maxing</a> was done by the designers. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pokémon X and Y</a></em>, it reached its zenith with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Mega Evolutions</a>, which are explicitly designed to be on par with the series's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Olympus Mons</a> with less stat points to go around. The Ultra Beasts in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a></em> are like the Mega Evolutions in certain ways too, with some extreme and specialized stat differences—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySharpBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySharpBlade">Kartana</a>, for instance, has one of the highest Attack in the game but its Special Defense is awfully poor.
</li><li> A similar situation also occurs with Abilities (passive effects that Pokémon possess). An ability that was introduced in Gen III, the generation that abilities as a concept was introduced, would provide something simple: For example, the ability Water Veil would prevent the Pokémon from receiving a burn. An ability that was introduced later might provide the same effect plus something extra: Water Bubble (an ability introduced in Gen VII) not only prevents burns, but also halves the damage received from fire attacks <strong>and</strong> double the power of water attacks (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangit">this effect isn't even mentioned in its in-game description</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonOmegaRubyAndAlphaSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonOmegaRubyAndAlphaSapphire">Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire</a></em> brought along Mega Evolutions for its Legendaries. Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre are exempt from the "only one Mega per team" rule, — essentially allowing three in a single party. Meanwhile, Mega Rayquaza, requires no item for its Mega Evolution to occur (it just needs to know a specific powerful attack), possesses an Ability that removes its Flying type weaknesses and other Weather conditions, has a base Attack of 180, and tied with Mega Mewtwo X/Y's 780 base stat total. It has the infamous distinction of causing a new Smogon tier called "Anything Goes" to be created, a ban list for the Uber tier which itself was meant to be a ban list.
</li><li> <em>Pokémon</em> is also a subversion in that many monsters from early versions of the game also frequently get new moves, abilities, evolutions and other changes to mechanics that make them much more playable. One such change was dividing all attacks into being physical or special, rather than one or the other based on its type. This allowed many Pokémon to make better use of their attacking stats.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0j5vy');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0j5vy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0j5vy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For example, the Kingler line has high Attack power, but since Water-type attacks were originally special in nature (thus running off its lower Special Attack), Kingler's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretArt">Secret Art</a> Crabhammer wasn't very useful. From Gen IV onwards, Crabhammer is considered a physical attack and runs off Kingler's Attack stat, allowing it to do a lot more damage.</span> The above-mentioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Mega Evolution</a> mechanic was also mostly given to older Pokémon.
</li><li> To give an idea of how egregious this can get, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Pokémon Diamond and Pearl</a></em> introduced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Arceus</a>, the <em>creator of the Pokémon universe</em> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll">120 in all stats</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">a wide movepool, and the ability to be any type</a>. Since then, while it's still a potent powerhouse, there are quite a few Pokémon with special forms, like Mega Rayquaza and Ultra Necrozma, who eclipse it in raw power.
</li></ul></li><li> Hits the later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechWarrior">MechWarrior</a></em> games. In <em>MechWarrior 4: Mercenaries</em>, the mechs added by MekTek when the game became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreewareGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreewareGame">Freeware</a> are often blatantly better in many roles than the vanilla mechs. In <em>Living Legends</em>, the later added mechs are better overall than the older mechs due to superior chassis characteristics and often better variants - though the older mechs were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">buffed to competitiveness</a> in the final update. Power Creep will be a game mechanic in <em>Online</em>, which takes place right at the time when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> is being rediscovered, and when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">Clans</a> invade with their superior technology - the old mechs with 3025 tech will be curb-stomped by the later 3049 or 3050 series of mechs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em> almost always subverts this; virtually all unlockable weapons have downsides (the few exceptions are gimmick melee weapons, which are technically better than the stock weapons, but worse than most of the other options). Anything that's considered a must-have tends to be a utility item that doesn't replace your primary weapon, such as the Heavy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatiatingSandwich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatiatingSandwich">Sandvich</a> (replacement for shotgun) which they use to heal their Medics, or the Sniper's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrineTrouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrineTrouble">Jarate</a> (replacement for SMG) which gives the character a team player tactic.
</li><li> Found all over the place in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigi">Mario &amp; Luigi</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario">Paper Mario</a></em> series. To elaborate:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiSuperstarSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiSuperstarSaga">Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga</a></em>, the weakest enemy has 4 HP, the first big boss has either 30 or 50 HP depending on which one you count, and the final boss has 1200 HP. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiDreamTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiDreamTeam">Mario &amp; Luigi: Dream Team</a></em>, the weakest enemy has 8 HP, the first boss has between 96 and 288 HP depending on which you count, and the final boss has 2417 HP. Bros Attacks, Badge effects and gear have also got progressively more powerful as the series has progressed. Averted with Battle Ring/Gauntlet bosses (the ones in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiBowsersInsideStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiBowsersInsideStory">Bowser's Inside Story</a></em> are stronger) and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiPartnersInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiPartnersInTime">Partners in Time</a></em>'s later bosses (which are harder than those in the last two games).
</li><li> This is easy to spot in <em>Paper Mario</em>, with the first game's weakest 'real' boss having 10 HP, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor">Thousand-Year Door</a></em>'s having either 12 or 20 HP, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario">Super Paper Mario</a></em>'s having 20 or more HP and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioStickerStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioStickerStar">Sticker Star</a></em>'s having 90 HP. The final bosses also have 99 HP, 150 HP, 200 HP and 500 HP respectively. The power of most attacks also went up in each game.
</li><li> Though all of these are cases of Power Seep when compared to the forerunner to both of those series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG">Super Mario RPG</a></em> had numbers similar to other RPGs of the time and even now: the player's HP caps at 999, enemies can have upwards of four digits, and the strongest attack does 9999 damage.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> has its iconic Fire Flower, which saw its usefulness diminish as the series went on. In the first game, it was the only way you could attack outside of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp">Goomba Stomp</a>, while in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em>, you had the Super Leaf and Cape Feather that also provided you with a decent attack, but added mobility boosts on top of that. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBrosWii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBrosWii">New Super Mario Bros. Wii</a></em> added the Ice Flower on top of that, which was basically a better Fire Flower. Many other games do something similar.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory">MapleStory</a></em> takes this trope and <em>runs</em> with it. Due to the age and lifespan of the game and the nature of it being a constantly-evolving MMORPG, this is bound to happen. Characters that are added later down the line have abilities that are astronomical compared to characters present during the game's launch. To their credit, Wizet often overhauls the older classes with new skills and animations to the point where they are still exceptionally viable alongside the newcomers. While the newer classes tend to be more visually impressive, the older classes can easily keep up damage-wise.
</li><li> This has been a problem with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em> concerning PVP as the game keeps tossing more and more starships with stronger weapons and abilities. The worst of the bunch is the Romulan <em>Scimitar</em> warbird. Outfitted the right way, you could essentially one-man an Elite PVE match and dominate PVP. In the same vein, people use this as to dump the <em>Galaxy</em>-class and <em>Galaxy-X</em>-class ships as this as they focus more on tanking than actual DPS, leading to them thinking of it as "useless".
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em> has had this problem since the arrival of the Romulans in the first expansion <em>Legacy of Romulus</em>. Romulan Bridge Officers have the ability "Subterfuge", with makes them fearsome when coming out of cloaking as they get a hefty damage bonus doing so. Getting an entire set of Bridge Officers with the better "Superior Subterfuge" means you can wreck things immediately coming out of cloak. It gets worse as many players will tell you that, if you want to get the best effect, have your Romulan character choose to side with the Klingon Defense Force as they'll tell you that their Vandal Destroyer (which includes the power level-booster Plasmonic Leech) and the Romulans' <em>Valdore</em>-class (which include the shield regenerating Shield Absorptive Frequency Generator) makes you a fearsome foe.
</li><li> The Tier 6 ships introduced in the second expansion <em>Delta Rising</em> has seen calls of this, especially towards older ships as they include an extra console slot, an extra Bridge Officer power slot, involve new powers and include abilities that make you even stronger.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em> suffers from this a lot for two main reasons. First, the game's mechanics are constantly getting refined and overhauled, but older equipment rarely gets revisited to make it work with the new mechanics. Second, there's the reason most power creep occurs: the developers want the new equipment to be relevant. Here are a few notable examples:
<ul><li> Before Update 13, heavy weapons ruled the melee world thanks to their powerful charge attacks. When Melee 2.0 removed charge attacks, heavy weapons didn't get anything in return, leading them to get outclassed by faster weapons which could be more easily used as mobility tools. Surprisingly, they did get a significant damage boost much later, allowing them to become relevant once again.
</li><li> The Boltor Prime is the most blatant example for primary weapons. Compared to their non-Prime counterparts, most Prime weapons have damage bonus between about 20% and about 40%. The Boltor Prime has a 120% bonus over the Boltor. And unlike most guns its accuracy doesn't suffer much from the damage-boosting Heavy Caliber mod. It's widely considered to be the "default" endgame rifle, to the point where many players dislike it because of how often it gets used. DE seems to have learned their lesson here, since while many primaries since have been on par with it, nothing has outright been able to outclass it.
</li><li> Newer Warframes tend to have more cohesive kits (compare Mirage to Saryn), but the real example is Prime Warframes. Initially, they were fancy reskins with different default polarities and a special interaction with the Death Orbs in the Void. That lasted until the fifth one, Rhino Prime, was released. In an unprecedented move, Rhino Prime had a statistical advantage over his base counterpart: his movement speed had been increased from 0.9 to 1.0. While the change wasn't game-breaking (without an Arcane Vanguard helmet, at least), the damage had been done. The very next Prime, Loki Prime, featured a significant boost to his energy pool, making it the highest in the game at the time. Then Nyx Prime came with two stat boosts, both modest and not especially helpful for her; this didn't stop Nova Prime from getting two significant stat boosts, one of which covered one of her weaknesses and the other of which tied her with Loki Prime for highest energy pool in the game. The real sign that things had gotten out of hand was when Volt Prime not only sextupled his armor, but also doubled his energy pool, putting him above even Loki Prime and Nova Prime. As of Update 16.11, we now have Ash Prime with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">three</a> moderate stat boosts. Excalibur Prime, Ember Prime, and Frost Prime were later updated to have minor armor or shield buffs over their base variants, but they're still nowhere close to the improvements of later Prime Warframes.
</li><li> Damage 2.0's scaling worked just fine when it was announced and still plays nicely until you get to enemies about level 50. Once you cross that threshold, however, enemies start to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">lightning bruisers</a> at all times. The Grineer in particular become nightmarish for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">Nigh-Invulnerable</a> if you don't have a way to strip their armor from them.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight between the first two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> games, where all the weapons in the original title were reused for the sequel. The presence of the heavily armored Enclave soldiers meant that classic heavy weapons like the Rocket Launcher, Flamer and Minigun were superseded by the accurate, devastatingly powerful Bozar as a reliable endgame loadout. Energy weapons received a similar treatment, with the rare Pulse Rifle receiving a special 80% Damage Threshold reduction perk that former standbys such as the Laser and Plasma Rifles lacked.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> used to have a problem with this with different gear of the same level. The level progression is almost endless — from one to 110 with the sixth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a> — so obviously old enemies and gear are going to become weak compared to the new. The problem, however, was that the new starting gear from an expansion would be more powerful than the max-level gear from the previous one. Most commonly used are three tiers of gear, Uncommon, Rare, and Epic, in order of increasing power. Starting from the first expansion, people used to say that mere Uncommon gear from the expansion was as powerful as Epics from the original game. This wasn't really true, but the new Uncommon was roughly the same as the old Rare; this gave more incentive to go into the new content, but it also removed incentive to eg. go through the trouble to craft some old Rare items or do some old quests. The same happened between the first and second expansion, and by the third one, it became true that the new Uncommons were as good as the previous Epics. After that, though, they revised all the power levels of everything in the game so that there was no longer any such gap with either the new expansions nor even the old ones. You still don't need to go to old raids to get powerful enough stuff to move into the next expansion, but if you've done it, you'll be overgeared at the start of the expansion.
<ul><li> One particular example came to life at the start of the seventh <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a>, Battle for Azeroth. The current one gives players Artifacts, a whole set of different powerful weapons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">both in game and in story</a>. The minute Battle for Azeroth is released, they became no more then a waypoint between level one and the up-to-date content. This was justified in-story by the player having sacrificed the power of their artifacts at the end of Legion.
</li><li> This happened with Trinkets. During <em>Classic</em>, Trinkets were an extra equipment slot that held a variety of purposes. Some were little toys that did things like put a disguise on the player. Others did things like toss a boomerang that dealt damage or summoned a cannon that fired on nearby enemies. Others removed debuffs. Others were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatStick">functionally useless but boosted stats</a>. Others gave a temporary buff to the player. And some did a combination. Naturally, the stat-boosting and buff-granting (Especially if it was a combination of both) were the much more popular ones amongst the players, because why bother wasting time summoning a ghostly ally to fight alongside you for a couple seconds when you could just be attacking? And why bother carrying around that neat little toy that makes everyone around you dance if you can have something that makes you deal more damage? As a result of this, most trinkets at max level just temporarily buff the player and give stats, since players would much rather use a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatStick">Stat Stick</a> that's lower level than a max level trinket that <em>just</em> tosses a bomb at the enemy. Future expansions would sometimes feature toggleable effects, but would combine them with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatStick">stat boosts</a> so that they would see play, while moving the trinkets that were useless in gameplay to the "Toys" collection instead.
</li></ul></li><li> You get this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks">World of Tanks</a></em> due to older tanks not being adjusted to new tank stats. For instance, the Super Pershing is a premium Tier 8 medium tank that used to be a decent choice in older builds of the game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">trading agility and firepower for amazing frontal defenses</a>. However, with the advent of fast, accurate tanks such as the Panther 58 Mutz and Patton Korea, as well as larger guns with ever-increasing penetration values, the Super Pershing is now considered one of the least favorable, least profitable of the Tier 8 premiums. This also happened to the KV-1 with the introduction of the O-I Experimental, a tank in the same league of armor and firepower but was a good 33% faster even though it was almost twice as heavy. To Wargaming's credit, they did try to buff the Super Pershing back to being a defensive powerhouse and nerfed the O-I series of tanks to make them less ridiculously potent, so they are at least aware enough of the trope to try and head it off.
</li><li> Similarly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarThunder">War Thunder</a></em> suffered badly from this after supersonic jets and modern tanks were introduced. When the F-100 and the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiG">Mi G</a>-19 were introduced, they simply outperformed any other jet that was in game at that time (even the Hunter F.1 and the CL-13 couldn't do much as they weren't fast enough to catch them). Then, missiles came, and while some subsonic jets got more competitive against supersonic jets (unless they ran out of missiles...), they became also frustrating opponents for those subsonic jets without missiles. Then the F-4 Phantom II came and even the F-100 became outperformed in every way. Thing is, in order to avoid getting a terribly long waiting time while searching for battles, tier matchmaking is compressed. Had the F-4 been put to fight only other F-4s or the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiG">Mi G</a>-21, then waiting times would have grown exponentially for players. So now for example you get the English Electric Lightning, which is a Mach 2 supersonic jet, at a battle rate of 9.7, the same for the italian G.91YS which is subsonic. Both have missiles, thus lowering the latter would cause it to face slower, underarmed Korean War jets.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</a></em> has this happen in the expansion packs. For example, the natural enemies you encounter in <em>Bloodmoon</em> (such as wolves and bears) are as powerful as enemies you find inside the Ghost Fence in Vvardenfell, home of the 4000 year-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. The expansion also contains some of the few weapons in the entire series which are stronger than Daedric.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria">Terraria</a></em> has gone through several infrequent but <em>major</em> content updates, expanding the number and variety of items available to the player at almost every stage of progression. Unfortunately, in many cases the newly-introduced items are invariably superior to their contemporaries, though the degree to which this happens varies.
<ul><li> For instance, one update introduced Tin, Lead, Tungsten, and Platinum, ores which are functionally identical to the game's original Copper, Iron, Silver, and Gold ores - any recipe that calls for one will have an identical recipe that calls for the other, and produces the same result, such as a Gold Watch versus a Platinum Watch, which both do the same thing. In fact, a newly created world would randomly pick just one ore of each tier to generate with. Hardmode introduces another set of ores which have similar alternate mirrors that the game will randomly pick from. However, weapons and armor made of the alternate set of ores are strictly superior to the original ores.
</li><li> Besides that, there's also a number of items which behave quite different from their old, in-tier cousins, but are nonetheless vastly superior. For instance, among Melee weapons, <em>good</em> early game weapons included <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFlail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFlail">Flails</a> which could hit lots of enemies but were difficult to use, and Spears which were great for playing keep-away but had much less range than Flails. The Ice Blade was introduced later, and can be found randomly in chests at the very beginning of the game if you're brave/skilled enough to explore. Between its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam">projectiles fired on swing</a>, good DPS, autoswing, and ease of acquisition, the Ice Blade managed to completely blow <em>every other pre-Hardmode melee</em> weapon out of the water except, arguably, for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> that requires a complicated crafting process to obtain and another sword that has a low chance of appearing in one of a handful of shrines that generate in a world.
</li><li> And then Patch 1.3 came along and introduced <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeWeapon">Yoyos</a></em>, with a behavior set and damage output that rendered every other melee weapon in the game almost completely obsolete, starting with the fact that they can effectively stunlock foes without effort and attack enemies around corners and through one-block-wide gaps with impunity.
</li><li> The power creep in Terraria can be best exemplified through what was once the game's true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a>; the <a class="urllink" href="https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Terra_Blade">Terra Blade<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Creating through an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals">extremely long crafting</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/terraria_gamepedia/a/a0/Terra_Blade_Crafting_Chart.png?version=49566e767b25457100cafbd18a06b17f">sequence spanning the entire game<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the Terra Blade had extremely high DPS, a projectile attack and didn't cost any mana for it. An extremely useful weapon and very powerful at the time it was introduced... Then <a class="urllink" href="https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Influx_Waver">the Influx Waver<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was introduced. Higher base power, a projectile attack that hits enemies <em>twice</em> and it has around the same swing speed as the Terra Blade, <em>without</em> the need to go through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals">Chain of Deals</a> to get it. All it takes is farming a boss from an event to get it... An event that opens up <em>around the same time</em> one would be able to craft the Terra Blade, effectively rending the Terra Blade useless!
</li></ul></li><li> Expansions for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac">The Binding of Isaac</a></em> have a tendency to introduce items that are objectively superior versions of items already in the game. The procedural generation keeps the old items relevant in lieu of better options showing up, but it does mean the power level of the average run has trended upwards with each expansion.
<ul><li> One example would be the case of flying - in the original game, getting the ability to fly was a rare ability only handed out by three items - Lord of the Pit, Transcendence, and the Pony. Of those three items, Lord of the Pit costs two red heart containers to obtain, Transcendence is one of the rarest items in the game, and the Pony takes up the active inventory slot that could be used to hold an item with a more helpful active effect. However, <em>Wrath of the Lamb</em> introduced four flying items that were either easier to obtain or came with additional benefits. By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">Rebirth</a></em> onward, it was rarer for a run <em>not</em> to stumble upon at least one permanent flying item, making the initial flying items seem redundant.
</li><li> The ability to carry more than one consumable was limited to Little Baggy and Starter Deck originally, which have the downsides of removing all cards/pills from the rest of the run unless the other was also obtained. <em>Afterbirth</em> added Deep Pockets, which unconditionally lets the player carry two consumables but is earned by playing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretCharacter">Secret Character</a> who is a massive grind to unlock and easily the worst character in the game, making the reward well worth it. Then <em>Afterbirth+</em> came along and added Polydactyly, which has the same effect as Deep Pockets, is a boss item instead of a shop item (so it can be obtained for free), is unlocked by default, and even spawns an extra pill or card on pickup. The other choices are kind of bad in comparison.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FireEmblemHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FireEmblemHeroes">Fire Emblem Heroes</a></em> has slowly developed this problem over time. Characters who were in the game at launch or released in early banners are generally outclassed by counterparts released later, due to newer characters having better stat spreads and more useful default skills and weapons. The devs occasionally update the weapons of old units to help bring them more in line with the current power curve, and the ability to give one character the skills or weapon of another can also help close the gap, but for some units even this can't make up for their weak stats.
<ul><li> For a good example, compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> infantry sword units who were available early on with some released later. Lon'qu had 39 Speed, the highest in the game at launch, in exchange for middling to poor stats in other key areas. While he remained the fastest even as other infantry sword units came out that eclipsed him in actual combat ability, eventually Mia was released, a unit who not only had higher Speed at 40, but beat him in literally <em>every</em> stat except HP, and came with a powerful unique weapon and useful skills to boot. And even she was outdone by the arrival of Karla, who also had 40 Spd, but higher Attack and an even more powerful weapon. While Lon'qu eventually received a useful unique weapon of his own (enough to put him on Mia's level, in fact), he's still roundly outclassed by Karla (who ironically enough, has been outclassed by Mareeta, Sheena, and Larcei). And that's not mentioning what happened to poor Athena, who got powercreeped by 3 units of the same weapon and movement type, including Mia.
</li><li> The upper limit of a unit's Base Stat Total (BST for short) can get ridiculous sometimes the later the game goes with the release of new heroes, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">Serial Escalation</a> levels of BST increases. At the game's launch, 157~158 was the standard BST for "Gen 1" Infantry melee units with the standard movement of 2, while "Gen 1" Armored melee units go around 168~169 to compensate for their lower movement of 1, and a unit with "Trainee" bonuses gain +5~6 more stats than normal. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBuff">Balance Buffs</a> were later released in the game's life, including increasing the BST of many units types for future heroes, including Infantry and Armored units, with Infantry at "Gen 2" having 162~164 BST, "Gen 3" 167~169 BST, "Gen 4" 172~173 BST and "Gen 5" 176~177 BST, while Armored units at "Gen 2" and "Gen 3" be at 173~175 BST, "Gen 4" 178~180 BST and "Gen 5" 183~185 BST. Great examples of this escalation are dragon units, using Corrin, Young Tiki, Kanna, and Sothis as examples of the gap between Infantry and Armored narrowing between generations, while also leaving older units in the dust.
<ul><li> Regular Female Corrin<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1u758');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1u758" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1u758');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Regular Male Corrin is a Sword Infantry, so he's part of another can of worms</span> was released at launch, February 2017, with 157 BST.
</li><li> Young Tiki was also released at launch with "Trainee" bonuses, with 163 BST.
</li><li> Male and Female Kanna were released at April 2018, during the "Gen 2" wave of BST units, with their BST at 163~164.
</li><li> Adrift Female and Adrift Male Corrin were released at November 2018, both with "Gen 2" and "Trainee" bonuses, with their BST at 167~168, reaching "Gen 1" Armored unit BST.
</li><li> Fallen Female Corrin and Regular Sothis was released at May 2019 and July 2019, respectively, during the "Gen 3" wave of BST units, with alongside the "Trainee" bonus, reaches 173 BST, reaching "Gen 2" and "Gen 3" Armored units BST.
</li><li> Fallen Male Corrin was released at May 2020, during the "Gen 4" wave of BST units, with alongside the "Trainee" bonus, reaches 177 BST, nearly reaching the "Gen 4" Armored units BST.
</li><li> Legendary Female Corrin was released at August 2020, during the "Gen 5" wave of BST units, with alongside the "Trainee" bonus, reaches 182 BST, nearly reaching the "Gen 5" Armored units BST. Still want to use that Regular Female Corrin?
</li><li> Legendary Young Tiki and Fallen Young Tiki, released at October 2018 and May 2019, respectively, are Armored Dragons with "Trainee" bonuses, so they reach 180 BST, the highest BST for "Gen 3" units in the game.
</li><li> To cap things off, Winter Sothis was released at December 2020, during the "Gen 4" wave of BST units, is an Armored Dragon with the "Trainee" bonus, so she reaches 185 BST, the highest BST for "Gen 4" units in the game.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Bejeweled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Bejeweled">Bejeweled</a></em> <em>Blitz</em> was hit pretty hard with this over the time of its existence. At the beginning, it was a simple match-three game with 1 minute to get a score. At that time getting over 500k was considered a feat. Then the coin system was added, and a boosts, which could be bought with those coins for three games each. This helped to get higher scores, but getting 1M was still almost impossible. Then they added gems, which are the straightest example of this trope - the first gem merely added three star gems at the beginning or a special score bonus, but now they have effect that essentially nukes the entire board for high score bonus, culminating with 'Blue Thunder' gem that allowed to score over <em>50 million</em> with the boosts. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">Then</a> the boosts became free, got stronger effect right from the beginning and each can be upgraded to level 11, with stronger effects. And finally it was sealed by adding new boosts, the latest of which, Quickfire, activates a Blazing Speed, making each match explode while giving ridicculous bonuses that you can score 50 million <em>without the gem</em> - which got stronger since the 'Blue Thunder' as well, meaning you can get over <strong>300 million</strong> now.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunterWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunterWorld">Monster Hunter: World</a></em> faced this through the game's free title updates. Each update introduced bigger and badder monsters, so stronger weapons and armor needed to be added to keep up, causing older gear to lag further behind.
<ul><li> The first update, Deviljho, featured weapons with the highest base raw damage in their weapon category, on par with the Diablos weapons but available for all weapon categories, along with high-level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Elderseal</a> and access to white Sharpness at any level of the Handicraft skill.
</li><li> The second update, Kulve Taroth, added randomly-dropped relic weapons, some of which have damage, Sharpness, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Affinity</a>, Non-Elemental Boost compatability, and/or element beyond most craftable weapons, let alone their standard counterparts.
</li><li> The third update, Lunastra, added weapons that not only had high Blast element, Affinity, above-average raw damage, and long natural white Sharpness, but wielding them granted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetBonus">Set Bonus</a> skills, one of which is exclusive to the final boss. In the base game, natural white Sharpness is exclusive to low-raw weapons like those from Hornetaur, Legiana, Odogaron, and the final boss. On top of that, the update added the Temporal Mantle, which allows the wearer to temporarily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a> even the strongest attacks. The effort required to obtain these items borders on them being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">Bragging Rights Reward</a>, but there was more to come, making them less so.
</li><li> The fourth update, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Behemoth</a>, added the Drachen armor set, one of the strongest sets in the series. It turns the user into an insane <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass">Critical Hit Class</a> with attack and Affinity-boosting skills, increased crit damage, a lot of high-value slots, and to top it off a set bonus that prevents Sharpness loss upon landing a crit, a skill otherwise exclusive to Teostra's armor sets.
</li><li> The last major shake-up, though not a title update, was Arch-Tempered Kulve Taroth's Kjarr weapons. These weapons had even <em>better</em> stats than the already fantastic Taroth weapons, on top of granting the Critical Element and Critical Status skills, the set bonus of the Rathalos and Zorah Magdaros armor sets. The skills didn't work at first due to a bug, but the weapons were <em>still</em> top-tier due to their stats.
</li><li> In the base game, most Elderseal-imbued weapons are of Low or Average level, with High level being largely exclusive to Nergigante weapons. Every craftable Dragon-element weapon introduced in later updates has High-level Elderseal.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarWarhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarWarhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a></em> got a case of this with the introduction of its sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarWarhammerII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarWarhammerII">Total War: Warhammer II</a></em>, with all the new factions shooting to the top of the tier lists in multiplayer (and their single-player units being markedly better than similar-tier units in the Old World factions). The release of the <em>Rise of the Tomb Kings</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a> saw the new Tomb Kings immediately shoot to the top of the list until they were subsequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">nerfed</a>, and the <em>Curse of the Vampire Coast</em>'s titular faction did the same upon release as well (with one unit, the Depth Guard, proving itself such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> in a tournament held to preview the DLC that it had to be put down for nerfs prior to the DLC's release). The <em>The Prophet and the Warlock</em> expansion pack, predictably, did the same thing to the Lizardmen and the Skaven upon release, with some of their new ranged options seeing them immediately take place amongst the top tier of factions (the earlier <em>The Queen and the Crone</em> having avoided this mainly due to High and Dark elves already being the two top armies at time of its release).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobilePhoneGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobilePhoneGame">Mobile Phone Game</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyBraveExvius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyBraveExvius">Final Fantasy Brave Exvius</a></em> has had a lot of problems in this regard like other games created by Gumi/Alim. Part of the problem is that there are two versions of the game — the Japanese one, which came out first, and the Global one, which hit about nine months later. The fact that Global players can "see into the future" by spying on the JP version makes it clear that Gumi and Alim are deliberately employing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">Serial Escalation</a> to drive player retention and monetization. The problem comes when the Global team decide they want to throw a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">Spanner in the Works</a>. In 2019 two characters, Esther the bunny-eared swordswoman and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Quirky Miniboss Squad</a> member Zeno the Beta Star, were released into the Global version in quick succession; they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">so far ahead of the power curve</a> that they not only deformed the Global metagame, they would have done so in Japan as well. Consequently, a number of highly-anticipated Global characters — new versions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Lightning</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Bartz</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalGeneration">Original Generation</a> character Akstar, and a bunch of other people who aren't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered">Purposely Overpowered</a> — were obsolete <em>before they were released</em>. The fans made their displeasure known loudly.
<ul><li> The shift in damage dealing and skills, when compared from game's release to 4 years after, is <em>extremely</em> staggering. TO demonstrate this, one of the earliest known way to deal most physical damage is either with dualwielding coupled with skills or equipment that enable two normal attacks or with barrage, a single-digit modifier skill that enable four consecutive normal attacks. With addition of multicast, chaining, and chaining families<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3ehhv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3ehhv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3ehhv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">skills with certain amount of hit and hitframes that, when used at the exact same time, will deal more damage</span>, casting skills with 30x modifier or more multiple times has become the norm.
</li><li> The existence of True Dual Wield and True Doublehand marks the start of high stat which increase equipment stat when holding two weapons or one weapon in two hands respectively. Before them, reaching 1000 in ATK or MAG is a big achievement. With those skills (considering that equipment stat are the same), however, ATK and MAG can go so high the bare minimum ATK and MAG a character must have to be considered remotely useful is around 2000 or more.
</li></ul></li><li> Mobile phone spin-off <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YokaiWatchWibbleWobble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YokaiWatchWibbleWobble">Yo-kai Watch: Puni Puni</a></em> has gotten bad about this. Originally featuring the standard six E-S ranks from the 3DS games, they would later add a rank above S, the SS rank. This would end up being the norm for a while, until they added the alternate univrse Enmas and made them SSS ranks. SSS would be the new normal, until the end of the Extreme Yo-kai events with the introduction of their leader Rin-ne and his Z rank. Z ranks would also be the first to break the level cap from 50 to 60, as well as the Attack and HP stats breaking 999. Z ranks have become frequent enough to fill entire pages of the Medallium. As of 2020, there's now ZZ rank Yo-kai, furthering the power gap.
</li><li> The mobile game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JurassicWorldTheGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JurassicWorldTheGame">Jurassic World: The Game</a></em> has this in spades. Originally, the strongest dinosaur out there was the T-Rex. After that came the tournament dinosaurs, which were at least understandable due to their rarity. Not long after that came the Hybrids, the most powerful of which was as strong as a T-Rex at level 10, and grew strong enough to one-hit-Kill them at level 40. Now, we have VIP dinosaurs, which are as powerful as some Hybrids, Tournament Dinosaurs for which the same goes, Super-Hybrids made with S-DNA, and finally Tournament Hybrids. To give an idea of how ridiculous this gets, the Yudon has 14K health. The T-Rex has 1.6K.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> series has run into this problem with its playable fighters: characters who debuted in earlier games tend to have far more simplistic and inaccurate movesets compared to those who debuted in later games whose movesets tend to not only be much better constructed and accurate, but have unique mechanics not found in earlier fighters. While some of the older fighters have received minor moveset updates, they still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">stick out</a> when compared to the newer characters.
