Because most people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseStatistics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseStatistics">don't actually understand concepts like "average" very well</a>, in a lot of people's minds this turns into "any given man is always much, much stronger than any given woman." Since a true hero never uses his strength against the weak, and all women are supposedly weak compared to him, it follows that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">a hero must never use physical violence against any woman, ever.</a>
</p><p>When applied to ordinary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarBrawl">bar fights</a>, schoolyard throwdowns, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsFightLikeGentlemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsFightLikeGentlemen">duels of honor</a> and so on, the trope is well-meaning if sexist (against both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreTheExpendableGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreTheExpendableGender">men</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreDelicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreDelicate">women</a>, albeit in different ways). However, when characters keep invoking it in situations where their female opponent poses a serious threat that might only be preventable by violence, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">it quickly becomes absurd</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism">Of course, it might be that</a>, rather than being motivated by pure nobility of spirit, this philosophy functions as a convenient way for the male character to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWasBeatenByAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWasBeatenByAGirl">the humiliation of being beaten by a woman</a>; if he refuses to fight against women, there's no way for a woman to ever prove she could defeat him at his full strength.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Since ideas about gender roles are in flux and tend to vary widely, modern media can be highly inconsistent about whether this trope is portrayed as a good or bad thing. If a villain refuses to fight a heroic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> on these grounds, it's a toss-up whether this will be portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">a sign</a> that he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">at least a warped sense of honor</a> after all, or as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">profoundly insulting</a>. If a hero can't bring himself to strike a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl">villainess</a>, it either means that he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealHero">chivalrous guy</a> or has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay">dated</a>, patronizing attitude toward women as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleBigot">one of his few character flaws</a>. Occasionally you'll even see both at once, particularly in heroic cases; the character's reluctance to hit women may be portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodFlawsBadFlaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodFlawsBadFlaws">a sympathetic flaw</a>; stupid and sexist, but ultimately born out of an admirable desire to behave ethically and avoid being a bully.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Action heroes (or villains) who invoke this trope even though they face female opponents find various ways to get around it. At minimum, they'll make a quip along the lines of "I normally hate hitting women, but in this case I'll make an exception" or "I don't hit ladies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman">but you're no lady</a>" before they start to strike back. They might try to find creative ways to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToWinWithoutFighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToWinWithoutFighting">defeat her nonviolently</a>, perhaps through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">trickery</a>; they might try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialPacifist">minimize the necessary violence</a> by using grapples or pressure point attacks rather than actual blows; or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatByModesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatByModesty">tearing off their clothes</a>; or they might <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">get off on a technicality</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">doing something that indirectly results in physical harm</a> to the female opponent without actually striking or firing a weapon against her. In supernatural settings, the problem may be resolved by the male character temporarily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">turning into a woman (or the enemy into a man)</a>, voluntarily or not, thus freeing him from a gentleman's obligations toward the fairer sex. Alternatively, the woman may become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> so the man isn't even fighting a <em>human</em>, much less a woman, anymore. In team stories, this often leads to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedGirlFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedGirlFight">Designated Girl Fight</a>, where female members of heroic teams always seem to end up being the ones who take on the female villains.
</p><p>Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediaWatchdog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediaWatchdog">Media Watchdogs</a>, this trope is often quietly applied without being explicitly invoked, especially in cartoons and other media aimed at children. This is often noticeable even when feeling obligated by the trope would seem completely out of character, or when the overall message of the work seems to undermine the whole women are weak and need protection idea that forms the justification for the trope. Sure, the work never says or implies that the female characters' combat skills are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurelyAestheticGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurelyAestheticGender">in any way different from their male counterparts'</a>, but somehow by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">pure coincidence</a></em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick">token female team member</a> is always the one who ends up fighting the female villains.
</p><p>Sometimes the reason is pure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity">PR</a>: even if a guy is justified and doesn't mind hitting a girl, chances are he will be seen as a thug if he does. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> as many a man defending himself in real life has been attacked by bystanders, mobs and even the police upon being seen hitting a girl, context be damned.
</p><p>Often a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicVow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicVow">Heroic Vow</a>. May be a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBigot">Innocent Bigotry</a> when it's portrayed as sexist, but the male character genuinely had no idea that some people would see it that way. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldNotShootACivilian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldNotShootACivilian">Would Not Shoot a Civilian</a>, which encompasses this in settings where women are not combatants. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil">Rape Is a Special Kind of Evil</a>. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeBasherBasher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeBasherBasher">Wife-Basher Basher</a> lives out this trope with righteous fury.

</li><li> Goku is rarely seen fighting women at all. Even when he was fighting Chi-Chi in the <em>Piccolo Jr arc</em>, he just knocks her out of the ring with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway">air-pressure</a> punch without actually hitting her. The only time where Goku actually did hurt Chi-Chi was an accident, when patting her friendly on the shoulder, which sent her flying though a wall due to his strength.

</li><li> Gohan is also like this, as he outright refused to hurt his crush Videl during the Great Saiyanman saga which pissed Videl off and she even claimed she was looking forward to facing him in the Tournament but she never got the chance. In the games Videl often tells Gohan not to "go easy" in their pre-fight dialogue.

</li><li> Chikage Rokujo has a very strict code about hurting women, and refuses to let anyone get away with doing so. In fact, his code is so strict that the only reason he ever shows mercy to men is because he's worried that the women who care for them will be upset if he hurts them too bad.

She refuses to do so, and, baffled about what to do, they propose knocking her out or tying her up. Integra points out that attempting this would be unfair because they outnumber her, and implies that there would be something thuggish and perverse about them attempting it because she's a woman. Anderson agrees, and instead the group settles on escorting her wherever she wants to go.

</li><li> Jakotsu, the flamboyantly gay villain with a crush on Inuyasha, was originally supposed to be female. The author changed him to male because she didn't want Inuyasha to kill a human-looking girl.
</li><li> In a battle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">early on</a>, Inuyasha cuts off the hand of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">Youkai</a>, Yura of the Hair, who looks like a young girl. Though it's still Kagome that actually kills her.
</li><li> Against Abi, Inuyasha remarks that he doesn't like fighting women, but she's so evil he'll make an exception. However, Naraku "gave" Abi a trident (made from his bones) that creates a defensive barrier. Eventually, it is Naraku who kills both Abi and her mother.

<ul><li> The title character refuses to hit a girl, saying that it's not something a gentleman would do. This becomes a problem twice, once with Miu who he trains with (but is told that if he does not try to fight back then it just hurts both of their chances of getting stronger) and with Kisara who HATES it when people don't fight her because she's a girl. Later in the series, when faced with this situation, Kenichi learns to compensate by using Jujutsu. Possessing many grappling-style techniques, it allows Kenichi to disable female opponents without striking them and with minimal violence.
</li><li> YAMI member Akira "God Fist" Hongo proves to be fairly chivalrous as well. When Shigure (alongside Apachai) attacks him, he brushes both of them off without actually striking back, saying in the process that he's not interested in fighting women (while in Apachai's case, it's because he's hurt from an earlier fight).

After Yukino offers herself as a hostage in order to convince the terrorists to let the passengers of the hijacked bus go, she asks them to do the same for Arika, only to be told that they're keeping her since she's one of Nagi's greatest enemies. When Yukino warns them that Windbloom will become their enemy if any harm comes to Arika, one of them is prepared to hit her, but Arika intercedes, telling them that her grandmother said that men who hit women are terrible people.

Mind you, Sanji may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALessonLearnedTooWell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALessonLearnedTooWell">implementing Zeff's beliefs more intently than Zeff intended</a>, in no small part because he remembers Zeff <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">threatening to castrate him if he ever learned of Sanji hitting a girl</a>.
<ul><li> Sanji was severely beaten (by CP9's Kalifa) as a result of this despite being far stronger than her. Nami was quick to point out chivalry isn't worth dying for and that there was no shame in running away if he was unwilling to fight Kalifa, but Sanji claimed he just couldn't. Seeing how torn he was over and Nami calls him idiot but then goes and avenges him by fighting Kalifa herself, Nami even said she did like his commitment to his ethics.
</li><li> Sanji points a gun at Nico Robin on one occasion, but admits that it was a reflex to protect Vivi. Sanji is also willing to block and counter blows from women, e.g Kalifa, Arbell (filler) and even goddamn Yonko Big Mom.
</li><li> The only time where Sanji or at least a part of him attacked a woman is in Thriller Bark where his shadow was put in a zombie penguin <em>Inuppe</em> by Gecko Moria. At first Inuppe was unwilling to hurt Nami and protected her. However Sanji's shadow soon forgot itself and mercilessly kicked down Robin when fighting her, to the shock of Chopper who had been counting on using Sanji's chivalry to beat his shadow. It's quite brutal and jarring.
</li><li> Sanji is often set against men who actively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl">hurt and abuse</a> women like Absalom and Niji (his brother).
</li></ul></li><li> Sanji's moral code is played with subsequent video games.
<ul><li> In the <em>One Piece: Grand Battle</em> video game, if you play as Sanji vs. any female character, his dialog will change. He'll still fight like normal, but he'll say things like "I'm so sorry!", "Oh no! What have I done!", and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">Someone else is controlling my legs!</a>"
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/OnePiecePirateWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/OnePiecePirateWarriors">One Piece: Pirate Warriors</a></em> video game, Sanji can't even <em>damage</em> female characters, and all attempts to attack them are bounced off as if they had a permanent invisible barrier, exclusive to Sanji. The game will give a big warning across the screen if there are going to be any female fighters in the level to confirm if you really want to continue after selecting Sanji as your character. You can still beat the opponent by building up team gauge on the mooks and having your partner come in to fight.
</li><li> In <em>One Piece Burning Blood</em>, Sanji has a special attack "I won't kick a woman, even if it means my death!" that causes all his attacks (including his special and ultimate moves) to comically change into hearts and causes his health meter's portrait and the face on character model to change to his "heart eyes" face, when fighting female characters. Unlike the Pirate Warriors series, Sanji can still attack female characters and "hearts" he produces can cause minor damage to female opponents.
</li></ul></li><li> Zoro may or may not be like this.
<ul><li> Tashigi <em>thought</em> this trope was in action when Zoro didn't kill her after their fight, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">but doesn't seem to understand</a> that due to her resemblance to his childhood friend, doing so would probably would have caused him to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">Freak Out</a> of epic proportions.
</li><li> In chapter 687, Tashigi claims that Zoro was holding back on fighting <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Monet</span> because he held a dismissive attitude towards women. This is left vague as Zoro does say there are some things he doesn't like to cut and if he can avoid it he will, but he doesn't let that stop him from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> cutting Monet in half when the latter was about to bite off Tashigi's shoulder.</span> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> On the other hand, Zoro <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation">was perfectly capable of bypassing</a> Monet's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh-Invulnerability</a> and killing her outright, but deliberately chose not to, instead splitting her in a way that she could pull herself back together from. When Monet tries attacking him again, Tashigi has to deliver the finishing blow, though Zoro claims that he would have done it himself had it come to that</span>.
</li><li> Ironically for Zoro due to his refusal to fight Marine Swordswoman Tashigi because she looks pretty much identical to the girl he kept trying to beat when he was young before she died, he gets accused of being sexist about swordswomen whenever he goes out of his way to avoid fighting Tashigi. Zoro really disapproves of just attacking innocent women for the hell of it. He flips his lid when Eneru fries Robin just for speaking out of turn because "she's a woman" and gets even more pissed when Eneru responds that he doesn't care.
</li><li> Even when fighting women who can fight back, he has a tendency to use the minimum force needed to beat them like Ain and Naomi in movies and filler whom he knocked out instead of slashing them down like he does with his male opponents. Zoro doesn't <em>like</em> fighting women, but he will if has to. The only female he has and would ever had fought seriously is Kuina whom he fought savagely and without hesitation before she died.
</li></ul></li><li> Usopp unlike Sanji and Zoro, fights quite a few women and has no real qualms about hurting them, though given his pathetic physical strength it's not like he was holding anything back as Nami and Ms Valentine (the first women he fought) kicked his ass effortlessly. However Usopp has some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Combat Pragmatism</a> and has defeated female opponents without physically hurting them: he defeated Miss Merry Christmas by having her partner Mr 4 take her out, he defeated Perona with some fake <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes">cockroaches</a> and fake giant hammer, he defeated Sugar by making a scary face that made her faint. The only time where he's actually attacked a woman is in the non-canon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OnePieceFilmGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OnePieceFilmGold">One Piece Film: Gold</a></em> where he took out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkChick">Baccarat</a> with his slingshot Kuro Kabuto after turning her luck powers against her.
</li><li> "Red Leg" Zeff believes firmly in two things: that a man should strive to be manly, and that it is the height of unmanliness to hurt a woman. He even proclaims that not hitting women is "the iron-clad rule of this universe since the time of dinosaurs".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Photon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Photon">Photon</a></em> is trapped in a transparent cell with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a> Keyne, who proceeds to pummel the stuffing out of him.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> zigzags the trope. Eponymous character Ranma Saotome has expressed that he doesn't particularly like to fight girls, in terms that nod to the reality that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardAbuseFemaleOnMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardAbuseFemaleOnMale">guys who hit girls are seen as scumbags</a>, which invokes this trope and plays it straight. Subverted in that he will still fight women without hesitation. Then double-subverted in that he vastly prefers to do so whilst using his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">Gender Bender</a> female form (so he doesn't look so bad), and he also demonstrates a tendency to go for less violent means of subduing female foes.

When asked why he doesn't draw and fight them seriously, he explains that he doesn't like to cut down women. It may be somewhat justified in that they're essentially his younger sisters, with it previously established that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Single Numbers</a> tend to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct">Big Brother Instinct</a> when it comes to the other Sekirei.

When Cologne summons her ace monster, Number 22: Zombiestein (a huge, hulking, ugly, undead beast) it seems unstoppable, ripping through Yuma's monsters and all his defenses. However, when Yuma uses an effect that summons Gagaga Girl, Zombiestein not only refuses to attack her, he seems to fall in love, offering her a bouquet of flowers. Sadly, Gagaga Girl rejects his affection, but he still refuses to attack, and that gives Yuma the opening he needs to summon Utopia and defeat Zombiestein, along with Cologne.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kuwabara is revealed to have "don't fight girls" as part of his personal moral code. He even refuses to fight the demon Miyuki during the Rescue Yukina arc, despite the fact that she is both deliberately challenging him and quite offended by this attitude. Yusuke, meanwhile, promptly steps up and reveals that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl">he has no problems with fighting girls</a>, declaring that he doesn't understand what the problem is with refusing to fight somebody who wants to fight you just because they're a different sex and proceeding to brutally finish her off. In the unedited dub, after beating her senseless, Kuwabara starts to protest Yusuke's actions in outrage, for which Yusuke reluctantly explains that Miyuki isn't a woman at all. She's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">Transgender</a> (presumably male to female, though comments made could be taken as making her to be a female to male) with breasts and male sexual organs, leading to the following amusing quote:
<div class="indent"><strong>Yusuke:</strong> The family jewels have <em>not</em> been stolen.
</div></li><li> Yusuke explains that he opened the fight by groping Miyuki on both the chest and crotch, the latter because something didn't quite feel right about the breasts. When Kuwabara asks if this means that Yusuke would have taken it easier if Miyuki had really been a girl, Yusuke refuses to answer. When Miyuki herself claims that Yusuke was actually extra rough because of her true nature, Yusuke batters her unconscious and insists he treated her exactly the way he would have treated any of his opponents, male, female or in-between. In essence, the scene manages to play the trope straight, avert it, and then subvert it in rapid succession.

He then says, "A lady? No, but then I've never met a <em>lady</em> who carries dynamite under her coat."
</li><li> And yet after that, Superman backslides into being bound by this trope. Fortunately for Metropolis, most of his opponents are male because, when he fights a woman, he gets slapped around a lot because he can't be shown striking her, even when she's clearly powerful enough to take one of his punches. He'll restrain her or attack her in an indirect fashion (like pouring water on Livewire), or a female superhero will step in (often after he's been dropped) and beat the villainess up for him.

<ul><li> Subverted in an early strip, where Charlie Brown is fed up with Lucy, and shouts at her. She challenges him to a fighting match, but he declines. Linus says that Charlie Brown should've slugged Lucy. Schroeder explains that Charlie Brown "would never think of hitting a girl, so he deliberately humiliated himself to hold on to his high moral standards." Charlie Brown responds that he was just afraid that she would beat him up.
</li><li> In a strip from the late 1950s, Linus takes Lucy on in a backyard boxing match but takes two hard lefts before he knows it. Stunned, Linus begins to get serious and then Lucy lowers her gloves and says "You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?" while Linus, saying "Huh?" then lowers his gloves upon which Lucy rips a left hook to Linus' jaw to knock him out.
</li><li> There is also a Sunday strip where Violet is annoying Linus, and she taunts about not being able to hit a girl. Linus then wants to throw something at her, but Charlie Brown chides Linus about how he is not allowed to hurt girls, to which Linus decides to slug Charlie Brown instead.
</li><li> In one strip, Charlie Brown actually does hit Lucy (not very hard) and he feels immensely guilty about it. He goes to Lucy's psychiatric booth and explains what happened as though he's talking to a completely differently person. She slugs him and he declares that, "I don't feel guilty anymore! Psychiatry has cured me!"

<ul><li> This is the rule among the Green Martians. However, Tars Tarkas warns a murderess:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><em>He may not kill you, Sarkoja, it is not our custom, but there is nothing to prevent him tying one end of a strap about your neck and the other end to a wild thoat, merely to test your fitness to survive and help perpetuate our race.</em>
</div><ul><li> Among Green Martians, the trope is also gender-inverted; women are expected to refrain from attacking men.
</li><li> The Red Martians are even more so. In <em>Thuvia, Maid of Mars</em>, when Nutus tells his son Astok that they must hide his guilt in the kidnapping of Thuvia, and suggests that killing her would be best, even his weak and wicked son is horrified.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><em>Cruel to their enemies are the men of Mars; but the word "enemies" is commonly interpreted to mean men only. Assassination runs riot in the great Barsoomian cities; yet to murder a woman is a crime so unthinkable that even the most hardened of the paid assassins would shrink from you in horror should you suggest such a thing to him.</em>
</div></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedeemingLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedeemingLove">Redeeming Love</a></em>: Michael Hosea is usually the model of chivalry, but when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">bringing Angel back from the brothel to which she ran away after their wedding</span>, he warns her not to speak on the way home because hes so angry he might not be able to hold himself back from hurting her.

But he doesn't say that he wouldn't have done it if necessary—after all, this is the woman who murdered his mother, enslaved him, and was about to invade Narnia.

<ul><li> This trope is mocked in one book. Sir Gawain finds out that his younger brother informed a potential (male) opponent that he would "never raise a sword against the skirts of womanhood." The other guy showed up in a skirt, and the poor, dumb brother let him win. Gawain is very disgusted with him.
</li><li> Variations on this trope come up a couple of times. <em>The Princess, the Crone, and the Dungcart Knight,</em> an adaptation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChretienDeTroyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChretienDeTroyes">Chrétien de Troyes</a>'s <em>The Knight of the Cart</em>, features a girl with a sword, who has to cope both with the fact that she's about eleven and that she's female in terms of getting taken seriously. Although people not taking her seriously is the only reason she survives the book, given all she ever gets trained to do is quickdraw.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>The Survivalist</em> series by Jerry Ahern. Sarah Rourke takes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCommunists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCommunists">Soviet officer</a> hostage and forces him to release members of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a>.

Whereupon their regimental champion was "promptly and informally challenged" by a female Vallahan.
</li><li> Played to the hilt in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em> series.
<ul><li> Although many of the women of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Randland</a> wield more political power than men, and are frequently seen physically abusing men, most cultures are extremely protective of women, causing many men to refuse to harm a woman for any reason. Many women, however, protest this behavior.
</li><li> Rand al'Thor is the most prominent example. He refuses to harm a woman even if she's an immortal agent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateEvil">Ultimate Evil</a> and trying to kill him using legendary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">magical powers</a>. He also goes out of his way to avoid putting women in danger, which upsets his Amazonian bodyguards immensely. In fact, Rand has memorized the name or identifying characteristic of <em>every woman</em> who died because of him or while in his service. He once goes into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> after a woman who tried to steal his throne and betray him commits suicide. The 12th book suggests that his behavior is the result of his growing insanity, which magnifies his chivalrous upbringing.

He will, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">spank</a> women who try to boss him around too much, even Aes Sedai.

During Ward's battle with May, he punches her, throws her through walls, hits her with improvised weapons, and threatens her with a power saw. This is after May takes the first shot, throws HIM through walls, hits HIM with improvised weapons, grabs the power saw first... and finally ends things by stapling Ward's foot to the floor with a nail gun before striking his throat to stifle his pleas for mercy and then jump spin kicking him into the land of concussions. And to top off the list of subversions, Ward was the villain and it was a very, very richly deserved beating.
</li><li> Enforced aversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alphas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alphas">Alphas</a></em> as (with one exception late in the series) all the women with overtly weaponised powers are evil so it has to be guys who fight them.

Not that they actually fight any less often, you understand — he's just forced to resort to verbal baiting and blatant sexual harassment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheATeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheATeam">The A-Team</a></em>: Face would never, ever hit a girl, but he once punched a girl in the jaw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">on accident</a> because he mistook her for one of the villain's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966">Batman</a></em>. The villains' girlfriends never got involved in the fights, Batgirl never got hit, and in one especially goofy moment, the villain uses a <em>gang of schoolgirls</em> to capture Robin, knowing that he's "too much of a gentleman" to hit a woman. Revealing exception: In "The Entrancing Dr. Cassandra", Batgirl actually takes several punches... all from invisible opponents.
</li><li> When discussing Lydia, Mike in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em> regrets carrying out this trope, stating he wouldn't have given her the same mercy had she been male, and points out she is as dangerous, if not more, than most male criminals he has ran across. Jesse then immediately takes up where he left off, which Mike also points out.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Buffyverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Buffyverse">Buffyverse</a>:
<ul><li> Subverted in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> ("Sanctuary"), where Buffy punches Angel and he punches her back, and Buffy <em>reacts</em> like a helpless woman... until Angel points out she could kick his ass if she wanted and she <em>did</em> slug him first, so the protestation is just empty air.
</li><li> Subverted in an episode ("Ted"), where Buffy comes upon Ted having just read her diary. She waits and lets Ted physically hit her, before smiling and remarking that she was so glad he hit her so she would have an excuse to pummel him.
</li><li> "Billy" in Angel the episode title-character claims he would never hit woman <em>but</em> he likes to watch men hit women which is extra twisted. The whole episode is the sick <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl">subversion</a> of this trope.

There's the complicating factor that Michael and Fiona <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> are in love with each other</span>.
</li><li> There's an interesting scene in "Friends Like These" when Michael, worried about Fiona (who is unknowingly with an assassin), channels his fear for her into a slap, maintaining the cover in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> moment for him. Interestingly enough, she's pissed and he apologizes profusely, despite previous episodes depicting them as having no problem hitting each other, and treating violence as foreplay.
</li><li> While Michael has issues hitting Fiona, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Thomas O'Neill clearly doesn't. When he kidnaps Fiona in "Long Way Back", he punches her multiple times in the face.</span>

When she still refuses, he moves her out of the way without hurting her, prompting her to attack him.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WalkerTexasRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WalkerTexasRanger">Walker, Texas Ranger</a></em> rarely features female villains presumably for this reason. The few times they do appear in the show, another way around it is generally found, such as the female ranger they introduced in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a> showing up to stop her.
<ul><li> In the episode "Forgotten People", a nursing home is run by a sinister group experimenting on Alzheimer's patients.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Zoey101" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Zoey101">Zoey 101</a></em>, when Zoey joins the wrestling team (or rather forced to by the coach), Zoey becomes disappointed when during the tournament, all of the male competitors would rather forfeit than wrestle her since she is a girl.

<ul><li> The reason why intergender boxing/MMA fights aren't promoted. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a> occasionally subverts it for entertainment value, such as Chyna's Intercontinental title reign. Some women in MMA and boxing have a problem with this, arguing that however unlikely they'd be to actually beat most male opponents, competing in the same leagues would give women's MMA a better chance of being taken seriously and making more money.
</li><li> A longtime trope in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a> (at least among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">faces</a>), averted when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a> (then Hunter Hearst Helmsley) hired a female bodyguard (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chyna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chyna">Chyna</a>), who was more muscular than most of the men on the roster. She established her position early on by beating up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart">Bret Hart</a> in one of her first appearances, without giving him a chance to hit her back. Then they went up against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a>, who had no such qualms, and thus made it OK for men to get physical with her (and occasionally, other women). She would go on to regularly wrestle men and win the Intercontinental title.
<ul><li> Often times if a heel has a female manager or girlfriend, they'll <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">use her as a human shield</a> when being chased by a face with a steel chair, because they know the face would never hit a woman.
</li><li> Amusingly enough, however, in Canadian broadcasts of WWE programming they will cut away from a woman being hit by a man (however justified it might be storywise) even today... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFight">women can beat women up</a> with no problems. Thus leading to ridiculous situations where a group of female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel">heels</a> can mercilessly pummel a female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">face</a>, but let a man come to her rescue and it's edit time.
</li><li> And it's not a dead trope in the States, either. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SpikeTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SpikeTV">Spike TV</a> (the 'Men's Network') apparently dislikes showing men striking women, even when it's a horrible heel. Or when it's a replay of something that happened during a pay-per-view. Showing a 275 lb monster heel legitimately (though lightly) concussing a smaller female is alright if the monster is female herself.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling">TNA</a>, whose programming is currently carried on Spike, frequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> this; it's often mentioned that Spike has promised dire consequences for any man who hits a woman on <em>Impact</em>, and the female heels often use this to taunt and bait the male faces.
</li><li> Part of it may be that Spike also airs the program in Canada.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Hard as it is to believe, this is one of the lines <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimCornette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimCornette">Jim Cornette</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMidnightExpress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMidnightExpress">The Midnight Express</a> actually tried not to cross if they could help it, and it was hard not to with all the females <em>fans</em> out for their blood just as much as the male ones.
</li><li> Hilariously averted on an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWERaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWERaw">WWE Raw</a></em> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SantinoMarella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SantinoMarella">Santino Marella</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BethPhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BethPhoenix">Beth Phoenix</a>, JBL, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a> are all arguing before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista">Batista</a> comes out and challenges Santino, JBL, and Randy to a fight at the same time. He then apologizes and tells Beth Phoenix he'd gladly kick her ass too. After Santino comes at Batista and gets dropped, Beth slaps him and gets slammed on top of Santino. This is likely because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusclesAreMeaningful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusclesAreMeaningful">Muscles Are Meaningful</a> and Beth is noticeably more muscular than the rest of the female roster. WWE hasn't had a problem putting her in intergender matches every now and then.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW">ECW</a> blatantly averting this would have to have been one of the reasons it became so infamous in the 90s. The biggest example would be the Pitbulls putting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Francine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Francine">Francine</a> through a table with a Superbomb. And the crowd went nuts for it!
</li><li> In many promotions, this can lead to confusing rules in Intergender Tag Team matches, where if one male participant tags in his female partner, his opponent has to do the same, thus raising the question of why tag rules are even in place and preventing the workers from building up proper tag team psychology in the match.
<ul><li> This was completely averted in an outstanding match few American viewers got to see - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson">Daniel Bryan</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GailKim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GailKim">Gail Kim</a> versus Tyson Kidd and Melina on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESuperstars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESuperstars">WWE Superstars</a></em> where the four of them threw the usual rules of intergender matches out of the window. Bryan and Kim especially used a number of double team moves on both opponents.
</li></ul></li><li> On the other hand, in recent years it became common for some male wrestlers to rough up obviously weak or non-wrestler women just to show what Bastards, Badasses and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkasses</a> they are. Usually the assailant will be a heel. Once, just to be a dick, Armando Alejandro Estrada got his wrestler <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Umaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Umaga">Umaga</a> booked to fight the tiny <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MariaKanellis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MariaKanellis">Maria Kanellis</a>. (Maria lost.) Another time, Kurt Angle hugged Maria in the ring only to give her an Angle Slam afterwards. The Great Khali once tried to attack Ashley Massaro and was only stopped when Jerry Lawler came to her rescue. Then Charlie Haas and Viscera got into a feud over who would date ring announcer Lilian Garcia: after Haas raked Viscera's eyes, the giant, temporarily blinded, grabbed Garcia apparently mistaking her for Haas (absurd, Haas weighed twice as much) and Samoan Dropped her, nearly breaking her neck. At first Viscera appeared to feel chagrin of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">My God, What Have I Done?</a> variety, but then both he and Haas laughed and explained that they'd set it up as a "hilarious" joke at Garcia's expense. But one incident with particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a> (a face at the time) hit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StacyKeibler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StacyKeibler">Stacy Keibler</a> (also a face) in a skit that was supposed to be <em>funny</em>. Austin kicked Keibler in the stomach and then knocked her out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">because she had declined his offer of a beer!</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">(There are some things you just can't do, and beating up a woman half your size for comedy is one of them.)</a> Keibler later was the victim of a similar assault (an RKO) from then-boyfriend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a>, but that was meant to show that the face Orton was turning heel.
</li><li> During the WWF's kayfabe era, this trope's most frequent use centered on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MissElizabeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MissElizabeth">Miss Elizabeth</a>, the valet of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage">Randy Savage</a>. During Savage's heel run in 1985-1987, particularly when he was wrestling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a>, Savage would pull Elizabeth in front of him, using her as a shield while he had a chance to regroup; Hogan would simply pick Elizabeth and gently move her out of the way, giving Savage ample opportunity to blindside Hogan. Also during Savage's heel run, he came close several times to striking Elizabeth himself (usually when he perceived her to be paying too much attention to an opponent, not opening the ropes or folding his robe correctly or some other minor misdeed) but always stopped short of actually striking her. Apparently, Savage (and the WWF) agreed that they wanted him to be a heel, but not such an outwardly despicable one.
</li><li> The rule of "never touch Elizabeth" began to be thrown out when Savage turned face at the end of the summer 1987, and while the heels never struck or punched her, Elizabeth was shoved and grabbed by both the wrist and ankle on many occasions, by such dastardly heels as The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HonkyTonkMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HonkyTonkMan">Honky Tonk Man</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndreTheGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndreTheGiant">André the Giant</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigBossman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigBossman">Big Bossman</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheOneManGang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheOneManGang">Akeem</a>. Savage's other opponents during his face run — Butch Reed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Meng" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Meng">Haku</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllenCoage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllenCoage">Bad News Brown</a>, and Dino Bravo — were satisfied with simply trash-talking Elizabeth, while "Million Dollar Man" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TedDiBiase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TedDiBiase">Ted DiBiase</a> rarely if ever acknowledged her at all; of all of Savage's opponents during his WWF World Heavyweight Championship/first face run, the fiercest of all the rivals (DiBiase) put his focus on winning the title. During Savage's second face run starting in 1991, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JakeRoberts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JakeRoberts">Jake "the Snake" Roberts</a> completely threw out the trope by slapping Elizabeth across the face during a memorable match.
</li><li> This was averted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AttitudeEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AttitudeEra">Attitude Era</a> and Ruthless Aggression Era in a few intergender tag matches where men and women on separate teams would get in some offence against their opposite gender. The likes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Lita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Lita">Lita</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Jacqueline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Jacqueline">Jacqueline</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MollyHolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MollyHolly">Molly Holly</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Ivory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Ivory">Ivory</a> and later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus">Trish Stratus</a> would have no objections to taking a few hits from the men.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheDudleyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheDudleyBoys">Bubba Ray Dudley</a> completely averted this in a tag match in late 2002 where he dished out body slams and clotheslines to Victoria with no hesitation along with both her male partners.
</li></ul></li><li> Normally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnMorrison">John Morrison</a> won't hit girls.

</li><li> In an effort to prove she deserved an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance">NWA</a> World Heavyweight title shot after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BillyKidman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BillyKidman">Billy Kidman</a> got one, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KiaStevens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KiaStevens">Amazing Kong</a> demanded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Tyler Black</a> give her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">God's last gift</a>, in order to prove she could "kick out of anything."

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon">Stephanie McMahon</a> abuses this trope to high heaven to get cheap shots at male wrestlers, knowing even the ones that don't snivel before the co manager of RAW wouldn't have the gall to strike her back.

In Poison Ivy's level Batman has to fight his way through female mooks, and the game is designed in such a way as to not allow him to beat them up, only incapacitate them with some sort of gas. On the other hand, in Konami's previous Batman game for the SNES (<em>Batman Returns</em>, 1993), Batman treats the female knife-throwers just like everyone else. Both games were made by the same team.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlue">BlazBlue</a></em>, this is one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">nicer traits</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Ragna the Bloodedge</a>.

Even though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Poison Ivy is the second-last boss in the game</span>, you don't actually get to fight either hand to hand despite having pummeled, dropped, tossed, hung, and concussed in various amusing ways a horde of (male) mooks.

<ul><li> This is still the trope played straight though as if it were any other boss in the game, the act of fighting Harley and trapping her would be a boss fight instead of a cutscene.
</li><li> In the sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity">Batman: Arkham City</a></em>, she charges at Batman again and this time you get to take the controls. Once again, she proves that she is absolutely not a match for him. Averted later when Batman is given female assassins to fight (though his Take Down moves will not have the limb breaking animation as it does with the males). When you fight Poison Ivy, you can throw batarangs that look like they are hitting her between the legs and causing her to scream like she is having the mother of all orgasms.

He will break down someone's door if he hears a panicked woman inside being harassed or nearly molested and calls the culprit behind the act an "animal" or "coward" before all Hell breaks loose. He is also supportive towards the females in his camp and acts as a brotherly figure to them. However, Arthur believes that all people, male or female, are capable of evil, so no one is entirely good to him, which means he'd kill a woman if he has to. And yes, you can make Arthur go around punching and shoving women to the ground or shoot them in the head, no differently than how he rough handles men. None of the women try to fight back and only run away. If you hurt enough women, he'll eventually sit down with one of his good friends in camp and discuss with disdain how he keeps going around hitting females for no reason, almost as if some other entity is making him do those actions, as he doesn't want to hurt innocent people who've done nothing to him. Yet the game allows him to do exactly that, although you get a lower honor doing so. The wouldn't hit a girl option would be to just go around verbally insulting women for the heck of it. In one scene when he is entering a bar, two women are standing in his way and he asks them how much they cost. When one of them retorts if that's any way to talk to a lady, he only says he had no idea he was talking to a lady. It didn't sound threatening, but either way it made the girls leave. He can't hit any of the females (or anyone, for that matters) in his camp but he can still verbally say things about them. They can, however, slap you if you insult them too much. Or until one of the men <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">thinks you're being too disrespectful</a> and knocks you out themselves.

When Vicky tries to crash the party and complete her evil plan, Timmy can't hit her because in this era of cartoons, a man couldn't hit a woman. In response, Timmy merely wishes for his fairy godparents to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">turn Vicky into a man</a>. Problem solved!
</li><li> In another episode, when Mrs. Turner as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionMom">Mighty Mom</a> faces one of the Nega Chin's henchmen, he refuses to face her because he doesn't fight girls. She retorts with "I'm not a girl! I'm a soccer mom!" and hits him with soccer balls.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em>: In one episode of the 90s animated series, the Thing says he can't hit a lady when he meets Malice. It doesn't take her long to convince him that she ain't no lady. Since Malice is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a> and has no compunctions about how she uses her forcefield powers she shuts Ben down real quick. (After this episode, you'll never say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway">her powers suck again</a>.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>: In the episode "The D in Apartment 23", Chris and Meg fight their entire school. Meg is shown killing waves of male and female opponents, but only one of Chris' enemies is a girl. He does not kill her until the camera angle is switched to a more distant perspective. Presumably violence against women is more acceptable if it happens at a distance.

She takes full advantage of him, knowing that if he laid a finger in her, he would put his reputation on the line. His girlfriend, Sonja, discovers this, takes Tammy on and tears her down, teaching her a VERY HARD lesson in humility.
</li><li> Harold Berman on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em> apparently does not hit girls (though he does beat up boys sometimes, and Helga has no qualms about punching him). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl">Wolfgang, on the other hand...</a>

</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures">Jackie Chan Adventures</a></em> had an episode where a villain who had been defeated by the J-team before created an anti-J-team made of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">evil counterparts</a> of the heroes: a martial artist to face Jackie; a master thief to face Viper; a wrestler to face El Toro; and the world's strongest woman to face Tohru. When Tohru and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> first met, Tohru didn't want to fight a woman so he tried (and failed) to make an adversary of one of the others. After it failed, all he did was dodging her attacks until he tricked her into running downstairs, which made her fall into a similar fashion to the one he did twice in one episode before his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>. (Well, she was indeed his evil counterpart).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em>:
<ul><li> In a full on brawl between the Justice League and Gorilla Grodd's Society in one episode, Giganta, a woman who can grow to the size of a several story building, causes Superman to pause by doing the "You wouldn't hit a lady, would you?" routine. So, Wonder Woman announces that <em>she</em> would and promptly decks her! (Superman does hit female villains, though, so it wouldn't have worked for long.) Amusingly enough, Giganta is a part of Wonder Woman's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery">rogues gallery</a> in other continuities.
</li><li> Heavily averted on the show in general though. Hawkgirl in particular tends to get beat up on quite a bit.

For added points, he didn't even realize that he was (sort of) a girl; he thought it was a weird disguise.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Popeye">Popeye</a> absolutely refuses to hit women. In one Al Brodax-era cartoon, he has to fight the Sea Hag and her vulture, so he gives Olive Oyl some spinach; he dispatches the vulture and she takes care of the Sea Hag.
<ul><li> In the original <em>Thimble Theater</em> comic strip Popeye felt conflicted about hitting the Sea Hag at first, but then decided it was okay because her mean nature makes her "no lady."
</li><li> In another Al Brodax-era cartoon, where the Sea Hag kidnaps Olive Oyl, Popeye comes close to hitting her, ordering her to let Olive go "before I forget yer a woman!"
</li><li> And sometimes, Popeye DOES give the Sea Hag a dose of corporal punishment... by giving her a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSpanking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSpanking">spanking</a>!
<div class="indent"><strong>Popeye:</strong> I know it's wrong to hits a lady, but nobody says you can't <strong>spanks</strong> one!

<ul><li> Subverted when Lisa has to deal with a bully and tries to hire Nelson, Jimbo, Kearney, and Dolph as bodyguards. They promptly decline as soon as they found out her bully is a girl, not because they don't believe in hitting girls, but because girls kick, bite, and scratch. Besides sometimes they fall in love.
</li><li> This is avoided with Bart. He can hit girls playfully or fight them seriously. This is mainly seen in his relationship with Lisa.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states a gag was suggested where Homer strangles Lisa. The creative team were dead against the idea, despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">having nothing against</a> the running gag of Homer violently strangling his ten year old son.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>: Often played straight, but sometimes averted ("Up the Down Steroid" and "Wing").

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperBestFriendsForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperBestFriendsForever">Super Best Friends Forever</a></em>, Solomon Grundy refuses to fight Supergirl, Batgirl and Wonder Girl for this very reason. They try to persuade him otherwise but he still refuses. Finally they decide that even though he refuses to fight them, it doesn't mean they can't fight him, and proceed to beat the crap out of him. Solomon Grundy is left to seriously reconsider his stance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em>: For some reason Tom will stop chasing Jerry if he disguises himself as a girl, presumably because of this trope.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> even before he fell head-over-heels for her, Silverbolt's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealHero">Ideal Hero</a> personality prevented him from attacking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl">Dark Action Girl</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale">Femme Fatale</a> Blackarachnia throughout the series. This fails to please anyone, as the other Maximals have no qualms over stomping her flat, and Blackarachnia herself is insulted by the idea that she's not a significant enough threat to fight.
<ul><li> To give you an idea of how far this goes, Blackarachnia shot him at point blank range and he still refused to hit her.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>, this version of Blackarachnia <em>does</em> take advantage of it. In "Along Came A Spider", she asks a gawping Bulkhead and Bumblebee "You wouldn't hurt a helpless femme-bot, would you?". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then she poisons them both</span>. There's no Silverbolt in this series, so it looks like Optimus Prime is going to be the one she uses most.

Kid Blink, leader of the strike, said "A feller can't soak a lady."
</li><li> Although Angel Eyes, the villain from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodTheBadAndTheUgly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodTheBadAndTheUgly">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</a></em> had no problem with hitting girls, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeeVanCleef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeeVanCleef">Lee Van Cleef</a>, the actor portraying him, absolutely refused to, requiring the director to use a stunt man in the scene where it happened.

</li><li> After a spat between NASCAR drivers Mike Skeen and Max Papis, Skeen's girlfriend angrily confronted Papis and slapped him so hard that she <strong>sprained his jaw</strong> such that he couldn't chew the next day. He remained stone-faced and walked away, saying <a class="urllink" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2013/09/02/max-papis-mike-skeen-slap-canada-truck-controversy/2756047/">"I never hit a lady"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Skeen claims Papis had earlier come to their trailer and grabbed Skeen's girlfriend; Papis claims that she slapped him <em>then</em>, too, and he simply pushed her to the side to reach Skeen, not even knowing who she was.
</li><li> A follow-up to the famous Milgram experiment, which tested to see if participants would be willing to give (fake) increasingly-painful electrical shocks to complete strangers, checked to see how people responded to shocking those of the opposite gender. It turned out that men were much, much less willing to shock women than vice-versa.
</li><li> This infamously bit actor Ken Gibbel in the ass when Linda Hamilton punished him for adhering to this trope during production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2JudgmentDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2JudgmentDay">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a></em>.
