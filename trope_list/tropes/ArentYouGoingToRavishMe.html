The pure, virtuous, virgin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">damsel</a> is now helpless against what is sure to be a lewd, ravishing, and depraved assault <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil">against her purity</a>. In desperation, she grasps the nearest blunt object, determined to protect her maidenhood with every ounce of her strength. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveYouNowMyPretty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveYouNowMyPretty">The barbarians leer at her</a>, coming closer and closer. There are too many of them, and she closes her eyes, preparing to feel the grip of one of their dirty, grimy paws on her flawless skin.
</p><p>Then...
</p><p>Nothing happens.
</p><p>The damsel opens her eye to see the barbarian horde taking interest in something completely different. Maybe it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YetAnotherBabyPanda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YetAnotherBabyPanda">Yet Another Baby Panda</a>. Maybe someone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CueTheFlyingPigs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CueTheFlyingPigs">cued the flying pigs</a>, and the barbarians have just got to take a look at this.

Maybe they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation">just happen to be gay</a>. Whatever the reason, the barbarians make it clear that they have no interest in the damsel whatsoever.

And who wouldn't be: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberatelyDistressedDamsel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberatelyDistressedDamsel">damsels put a lot of effort</a> into being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureAdoresAVirgin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureAdoresAVirgin">pure and fair</a>, and it's offensive to blow up castles, slay tons of palace guards, and break apart all of that furniture, just to ignore the goods once you get there.
</p><p>Basically, any time a female in a story is ignored or passed over in a situation that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginTension">would seem to suggest</a> that she was about to become the target of some kind of sexual assault before the trope came into play, and she becomes angry about it, even though logic would dictate that she would be pleased with this turn of events. Apparently, the woman feels insulted that she is seemingly not attractive enough to be the target of such actions, thus warranting indignation. It's not that she <em>wants</em> to be assaulted per se, but getting passed over like that hits right in the pride, you know?
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>A slightly more innocent variation is in the cases such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunbagAirbag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunbagAirbag">Funbag Airbag</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanksForTheMammary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanksForTheMammary">Thanks for the Mammary</a>, or other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPervert">Accidental Pervert</a> moments, in which the "victim" is left upset/disappointed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CovertPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CovertPervert">that it was unintentional</a>.
</p><p>This trope is usually sexual in nature, though variants can include non-sexual examples of victimization ("The monster isn't trying to eat me? What, am I not delicious enough?" "What do you <em>mean</em> they didn't want to steal my <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar">Cool Car</a>?"). Similarly, though the would-be victim is usually female, males can be targeted, though their would-be aggressors are more likely to be male, or use one of the non-sexual variants. When male-on-male situations do use the sexual variants, the would-be victim is often portrayed as homophobic for an extra bit of irony.
</p><p>If it's the hero who's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero">refusing to take advantage of the heroine</a>, this can overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveTheInfluence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveTheInfluence">Above the Influence</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotDistractedByTheSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotDistractedByTheSexy">Not Distracted by the Sexy</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beastars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beastars">Beastars</a></em>, Haru is so used to getting it on with her male acquaintances, that she is dumbfounded when Legosi <em>doesn't</em> want to have sex with her in exchange for helping her a bit with her garden. (Legosi, meanwhile, is genuinely dumbfounded why Haru is getting naked and trying to take off his pants.) This ends up enabling a deeper relationship between the two.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoardingSchoolJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoardingSchoolJuliet">Boarding School Juliet</a></em> anthology, neither of the teenage protagonists are comfortable with actual sex yet, but Percia's annoyed because her boyfriend isn't comfortable with sexual touching of <em>any</em> degree.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter">City Hunter</a></em>, Kaori actually takes <em>offence</em> that Ryo won't try and jump her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/CLANNAD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/CLANNAD">CLANNAD</a></em> teases with a scene where resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> Kyou and Tomoya both get locked in an equipment storage shed. At first she's quite upset that this happened (apparently because of a spell cast on him right before this scene), but then goes into full blown dere-dere mode when Tomoya yells that he'll take care of it, says its his first time too, and tells her to turn around while he takes his shirt off. Then it turns out he just did that in order to lift the spell (also taught to him right before the scene), and the door opens right away, as another student opens it from the outside.

It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squicky</a> to see <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a 14-year-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilleFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilleFatale">Fille Fatale</a> named Nana Kashima</span> strip naked in front of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Albert a.k.a. 004</span> while telling him he's a coward <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotDistractedByTheSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotDistractedByTheSexy">for not wanting to have sex with her</a>, and it's also heartbreaking because the person doing this is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a deeply wounded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Broken Bird</a> with an awful life, and who breaks down in tears when Albert <em>again</em> refuses to do her.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DesertPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DesertPunk">Desert Punk</a></em>, there are multiple occasions where bandits attack and a girl screams and cowers while shrieking "I'm going to be raped!", while the bandits just look at her with utter disinterest. This may be because the girl or woman is exceptionally unappealing, or, in the case of one major character's first encounter with the main character, it's because she's too young and flat to interest him (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even though she's barely younger than him</span>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, Bulma is in the hands of Lord Pilaf. Lord Pilaf wants to know where the last Dragon Ball is and he promises to do "humiliating" things to her should she say no. Instead of what Bulma is fearing, he instead blows her a kiss. This is enough to freak out Pilaf's underlings (kissing is a really big deal in Japanese culture), but all Bulma has to say is, "That's all?" She then proceeds to describe what she thought Pilaf would do the way things were going (involving a lot of censor bars in the manga) and which proceeds to thoroughly squick Pilaf out: "AAAUGH! What a diseased mind! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">H-how can you even stand to THINK of such hideous things?!</a>" Pilaf decides to dump her back into the dungeon with Goku and the others before deciding to knockout-gas them in order to find the Dragon Ball in question. (The French version of the anime has Pilaf <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">Breaking the Fourth Wall</a> by protesting that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness">it is a kids' show, and they can't show such things</a>.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> features a non-sexual version of this in Episode 46. The heroes are on an alien planet, battling the Superhuman Water, an ooze-like substance that drains the power of anyone it touches. When it has the opportunity to drain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JacoTheGalacticPatrolman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JacoTheGalacticPatrolman">Jaco</a>, it completely ignores him and continues chasing Goten and Trunks, prompting Jaco to shout "What, aren't I good enough?!"

Sella's obviously embarrassed and Shirou cautiously chooses "dinner," but that only makes her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">fly into a rage and hit him</a>.

Throughout the rest of the story, the villains' goons manage to kidnap her and her friends several times (they keep escaping) and she also accuses the goons of wanting to take advantage of her while engaged in the same wishful thinking. Finally, after yet another rescue from a captivity in which they'd kept her subdued with drugs, Wilma rather hopefully asks Kirby and his new Southern girlfriend Bonny Lee whether those goons were having their way with her while she was in that helpless state and Bonny, realizing what she <em>really</em> wants to hear, just tells her "You plumb wore those poor boys out!" Wilma then pretends outrage even though she's obviously relieved to be told somebody finally noticed her.

Later on in the movie, King Louis is replaced by his doppelgänger, Jaques, the Garcon du Piss, in anticipation of the impending French Revolution. Rimbaud, completely unaware of the ruse, enters his chambers, rips open her dress, and begs him to ravish her. Jaques' response? "Gee, thanks, but I just ate."

As time passes and nothing happens to her, however, we see that they're planning no such thing, and that she's actually getting rather annoyed because no one's paying very much attention to her at all.

<div class="indent">Farmer Jones was in town picking up supplies.

Now he had a problem — how to carry all his purchases. The livestock dealer said, "Why don't you put the anvil in the bucket, carry the bucket in one hand, put a chicken under each arm and carry the goose in your other hand?" "Hey, thanks!" the farmer said, and off he went. While walking he met a fair young lady with rather large beautiful breasts. She told him she was lost, and asked, "Can you tell me how to get to 1515 Mockingbird Lane?" The farmer said, "Well, as a matter of fact, I'm going to visit my brother at 1616 Mockingbird Lane. Let's take a short cut and go down this alley. We'll save half the time to get there." The young lady said, "How do I know that when we get in to the alley you won't hold me up against the wall, pull down my skirt and ravish me?" The farmer said, "I am carrying a bucket, an anvil, chickens and a goose. How in the world could I possibly hold you up against the wall and do that?" The young lady said, "Set the goose down, put the bucket over the goose, put the anvil on top of the bucket, and I'll hold the chickens."

That evening when the masochist arrives, the sadist says "Make yourself comfortable and I'll be right back." The masochist disrobes and tingles with anticipation.

When the man who calls himself "the Fetch" has captured the protagonist and she wakes up from unconsciousness, discovers someone stripped her of her clothes, bathed her and dressed her in something else, she is understandably upset. The Fetch then essentially tells her, "That was me, but don't worry, you are too plain for my tastes." She is hurt by the statement that she's plain, but does not for a moment think about the fact that he essentially told her he <em>would</em> have raped her if she was pretty. Since he's threatening her life, it is reasonable that she wouldn't waste time by angsting over the groping and ogling that certainly <em>did</em> take place. However, on the other hand, she seems to have plenty of time to angst about him not finding her pretty enough and her thoughts return to this a couple of times — but never to the implication that he would have raped her if she was prettier. She doesn't even realize this when, later on, a very beautiful woman (whom the protagonist has recently freed from an existence as rape slave) tells her that she need not be jealous because beauty is not always an advantage.

He tells her that's no way for a young lady to act. She's not offended, though, just doesn't take "no" for an answer.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TowerOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TowerOfGod">Tower of God</a></em> has a bit of a recurring theme of women being convinced about their sexual attractiveness yet neurotically insecure about it. In "The Strongest Regular", Yeon Ehwa had been forced to team up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Slimeball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Slimeball">Prince</a>, who saw her as a girlfriend bought to him by his rich father. He was arrogant enough to offer her to anyone who could beat his team in the ongoing test — which Jue Viole Grace won easily. Since Viole also basically announced himself to be an enemy, Ehwa was understandably nervous about sharing a room with him in the next stage of the tests. However, she became absolutely furious and started plotting revenge when he rebuffed her worries by saying he wasn't interested in her body.

In another, he returns home to angrily confront his father about the damage it did to his self-esteem that his father <em>didn't</em> molest him as a child (because he thinks his father not molesting him means he never actually loved him).
