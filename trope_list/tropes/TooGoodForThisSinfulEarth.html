In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, this trope is a common way to understand tragic deaths among those who believe in some form of positive destiny.
</p><p>Often a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByNewberyMedal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByNewberyMedal">Death by Newbery Medal</a> (a major reason why this trope still lives on and in many people's minds why this trope has yet to be <em>really</em> discredited, or at least is still used). It was especially popular in 18th and 19th-century Romantic literature, where there was a series of characters who committed suicide because they felt they were too sensitive or too idealistic for a crass, corrupt worldfrom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSorrowsOfYoungWerther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSorrowsOfYoungWerther">Werther</a> in 1774 to Delphine Gay de Girardin's <em>Napoline</em> in 1833, by which time the trope waned in popularity. Needless to say, in the hands of an inexperienced author, this trope is prone to be used badly.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">The Unfavorite</a> is often the surviving child. Indeed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalFavoritism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalFavoritism">Parental Favoritism</a> may not even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShouldHaveDiedInstead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShouldHaveDiedInstead">really kick in until the Favorite is dead</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittlestCancerPatient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittlestCancerPatient">Littlest Cancer Patient</a> could be considered the modern take of this trope, but with a slight hope of healing and living for the affected kid (and also more likely to be played for comedy).
</p><p>This trope often overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">What Measure Is a Non-Human?</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal">I Just Want to Be Normal</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinocchioSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinocchioSyndrome">Pinocchio Syndrome</a>, and some variant of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant">Gentle Giant</a>, in characters that are created by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScience">Mad Science</a> or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad">regular science</a>. In this type of story, the artificial creature is too <em>innocent</em> for this sinful Earth and is at risk of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">being corrupted by it</a>. Sometimes, instead of dying, the "monster" chooses voluntary exile. Also overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge">Stuffed into the Fridge</a> in that the death is often a device to spur the heroes to fight on, although Fridging is usually a lot more shocking and gruesome.

</p><p>Not to be confused with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a>, who <em>sees himself</em> as "too good", and his duty as being to wipe away all the "sin" by any means possible.

</li><li> Marco Bott, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>. Idealistic, kindhearted, genuinely selfless without any sort of complex, always there to encourage the others, and pivotal in holding the 104th Trainees Squad together emotionally during their first battle.

<ul><li> Daisaku Bandai was the former Ultimate Farmer and the Future Foundation branch leader in charge of distributing food in the post-apocalyptic world. Despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant">his intimidating appearance</a>, he's a very kind and easygoing guy with the voice of a small child and a habit of creating random proverb-esque sayings that make zero sense.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He's the second victim in the Final Killing Game, dying an extremely cruel and unfair death when his Forbidden Action is triggered and poisons him.</span> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His Forbidden Action code was "witness violence by participants"; he died because he was present when Juzo Sakakura kneed Ryota Mitarai the chest.</span> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Given that at least half the participants in the Killing Game were either prone to violence or saw violence as the answer to everything (including actual violence itself) the poor guy never stood a chance.</span>

Despite the fact that he wears a bull mask and can be <em>very</em> scary if provoked, he's actually a rather gentle and polite soul with strong morals and a deep sense of loyalty to his comrades. Once the Final killing Game starts, he declares that he won't kill anyone, even if it costs him his own life, and protects Makoto Negaei and Aoi Ashina from Sakakura.

</li><li> Seiko Kimura is the former SHSL Pharmacist who, despite being part of the radical faction of the Future Foundation, is willing to treat her ideological rivals wounds. Despite her creepy appearance and demeanor, she is actually a very caring person with zero self-esteem who simply wants to be useful to everyone. While she does end up chasing and trying to kill her former friends Ruruka and Sonosuke, it's out of long-repressed anger at Ruruka's apparent "betrayal" in high school and how she used her throughout their friendship, and Seiko ends up giving up without harming them. As the third sleeping phase approaches she curls up in a hallway and thinks about how all she wanted was to have one true friend. She had actually loved Ruruka dearly and still wished that they could somehow make up.

<ul><li> In the Aincrad arc, Sachi, the only female of the Black Cats of the Full Moon, was a girl who hated fighting, but also the kindest and nicest of all of them, and her death is what drove Kirito to go solo for so long because he was unable to protect her as he promised. To drive the point home, she preemptively recorded a message for Kirito, telling him that he shouldn't blame himself if she died and that she was happy she could meet him.
</li><li> Yuuki Konno in the Mother's Rosario arc is a cheerful girl who encourages everybody around her to live their lives to the fullest and quickly gathers fame as the strongest swordfighter in all of Alfheim Online, never losing a single duel.

This is intended to be ironic, as the title character has been dead for 100 years, has a wonky eye, is childish, has hair like straw, and tends to directly cause the deaths of nearly every person or animal she encounters — the closing, in fact, seems to indicate that her death is the <em>opposite</em> of this trope, with nature finally getting around to fixing a mistake.

<ul><li> Spider-Man's girlfriend Gwen Stacy is treated this way in retrospect. Before her death, she was a more well-rounded character who was actually allowed to have flaws like a real human being, but the way she's spoken of nowadays has earned the sarcastic nickname "St. Gwen."

After her second death, she didn't loom as large over the books, partly because her primary torchbearer, Cyclops, was already falling for someone else when it happened, and partly because she'd been incorrectly labelled as someone who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">kept dying</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhoenix">and coming back</a>, though Wolverine still worships her memory.

He sits and plays one of the most lovely songs the world had ever heard during a battle and is killed by an enemy ignoring it. This is presented as an indication of how cruel war is.
</li><li> Georgiana, from Nathaniel Hawthorne's "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBirthmark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBirthmark">The Birthmark</a>", had a birthmark on her cheek. When her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> husband eventually removes it, she dies, going directly to heaven since she has no other flaws separating her from being an angel. At least, in this case, it is clear from the start that Georgiana and her husband Aylmer are allegorical figures rather than realistic human beings. Often mistaken on superficial readings as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad">Science Is Bad</a>, the story actually deals with obsession and hubris; for modern readers, the story works as an allegory for the often-fatal obsession with cosmetic surgery.

One day, when the electricity comes back on, she goes down to their old basement apartment to write her parents a letter. As she is going back up, the power goes out and she dies in the elevator. Alex and Julie find her 3 days later.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonBones">Dragon Bones</a></em>, this is averted with Ciarra.

However, the longer she stays away from castle Hurog, with which something is <em>seriously wrong</em> the more she looks and acts her actual age of sixteen instead of twelve, and is in the middle of the novel seen being as much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissSnarker">Little Miss Snarker</a> as she can be, considering that she's mute.
</li><li> In Edith Pattou's <em>East</em>, the main character, Rose, was born to replace her dead older sister Elise, her mother's favorite child.

The words "clear" and "pure" are used to describe him more than once. Turns out, he's the youngest of 12 knights destined to give their lives to help keep the Queen of the kingdom alive. You know the rest... This turn is heavily foreshadowed by Eddings, who has his <em>characters</em> actually discuss Parasim with language like "He's too good for this world" and "God will probably call him home very soon." It's actually a comfort to Sparhawk when he finds out (after the fact) that Parasim's death was in a good cause. What's especially notable in that this reveals more about the other characters than Sir Parasim himself. As old professionals, they've seen the good ones die young often enough to recognize the signs.

Even by Kindar standards, he is quiet, humble, and completely without a violent bone in his body. Snyder killed him off at the end of the trilogy...but then realized she made a mistake with that and inverted the trope with possibly the first <em>canonical</em> video game sequel to a book.

Well, the narrative does not so much carry this trope as flamboyantly juggle it while singing the complete score to Handel's Messiah. Few works treat a little girl freezing to death as such an unequivocally wonderful thing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittleMermaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittleMermaid">The Little Mermaid</a></em>, by Hans Christian Andersen, subverts this trope. The innocent and sweet mermaid who sacrifices her undersea life for love ends up giving up the boy she loves and sacrificing herself instead. However, the story makes it clear throughout that she doesn't have a soul — and upon her death, she is given a purgatorial afterlife where she might, with hard work and dedication, win a soul and go to heaven. So after her death, she begins to work her way <em>up</em> to Too Good For This Sinful Earth. Depressing, but not hopeless — which could well be the point.

Subverted, however, in that Ralph is the only one of the group who actually cares... and aside from Piggy, seems to be the only one who <em>notices</em>, or at least, be willing to admit noticing. Simon was a full-fledged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">Christ figure</a>.

He was not only a perfect little boy (incredibly intelligent, good at sports, insightful, said the darndest things, etc.) but didn't lose his cheerful disposition despite being kidnapped and almost murdered — his mother Jennifer was so desperate to prevent that she asked a <em>Mafia prince</em> to do everything he could to rescue him, up to and including killing the kidnapper. Jennifer sees his ultimate demise as karmic payback for, during the aforementioned trip, spending a night with his father Adam (the boy was the product of an illicit affair).

<ul><li> <em>Superior Court</em>: A couple of episodes:
<ul><li> There was the episode where a defendant, a cult leader was accused of killing several young women. He unsuccessfully tried to justify the killings as God telling him the women were too innocent and pure to live in this world. Needless to say, he was convicted and sentenced to death.
</li><li> In an early first-season episode focusing on the rights of the accused vs. victims' rights, a court hearing is held to remand a 7-year-old girl to the custody of the state after she killed her younger sister. The hearing reveals that the girl had been viciously sexually abused by her father (a respected Southern Baptist minister and community leader) and that he was starting to target the younger child, who was 5. The truth comes out only after the girl's father is removed from the courtroom (when the judge noticed the girl was intimidated and taking cues from her father). In the end, the judge acquits the girl, saying she indeed was trying to protect her sister and stop the cycle of abuse ... she was too good and innocent to endure her father's abuse. (He is taken into custody, charged, tried, convicted, and sentenced to prison.)

So naturally he dies of a terminal cancer in the pilot episode. Of course, his death is the central premise of the show: his three closest male friends come together in the titular Council to help his wife and children however they can.

Myrcella is acknowledged by Cersei herself who pointed out that Myrcella was kind, sweet and never had the awful qualities of her brother Joffrey. But because of her blood as a Lannister who happened to be in the firing range between an old house rivalry she died, and it's sad to see her go like that.

</li><li> Fat Walda is one one of the very few pleasant Freys shown so far, and the only member of the Bolton family to show Sansa some sympathy during Season 5. This, coupled with the fact that she's pregnant, makes you wonder how long she will survive. Not long, actually. Ramsay murders her and her newborn baby in "Home" by having them devoured by hounds.
</li><li> There is also Rickon Stark. Aside from a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">Creepy Child</a> moments in the early seasons, he was generally a sweet kid who just wanted to be with his family.

Not "sinless" by many people's standards.

Sure, she was in prison for a reason- but it was a minimum-security prison for a non-violent offense. Plus she was the friendliest inmate- kind towards everyone, always in a good mood.

While many are controversial (for example, characters played by Jamie Brewer tend to get this treatment despite being a little morally questionable - to the extent that it's actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in the fourth season), the examples of Ma Petite and Salty in <em>Freak Show</em> are pretty well undisputed. They're both shown to have the mindset of children and are rare characters in the franchise who are never shown to harm <em>anyone</em> - yet Ma Petite <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is murdered so that her body can be put on display</span> and Salty <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">dies in his sleep of a genetic condition</span>.

However, since the tragic death of Meep's actor Ben Woolf not long after the series ended, this trope seems to have taken firmer hold for his final character as well.

He's shot in the throat at a bar by a crazy person after news breaks about his "involvement". A key factor to Gideon's character?

They are a talented, compassionate, cross-dressing (and homosexual) percussionist who wastes away from AIDS, which is depicted in the movie.

This is certainly justifiable from our point of view because Richard almost certainly had them killed, but in Richard's time there was no big outcry - people didn't sentimentalize childhood as they do now, and the average Englishman of Richard's time didn't care about the Princes' deaths as much as he did about the survival of his own children, which was more likely under the stable government Richard had set up.
<ul><li> IRL, he probably didn't do it. The evidence they've got at The Tower of London paints a pretty convincing case for Henry being the guy who did it.
<ul><li> That's a bit generous. He remains to most historians the most likely suspect, but there's nothing totally conclusive; Henry VII is a distant third as the most likely (#2 is Buckingham, to most people).
</li><li> There are documents dealing with the princes' care dating after Richard died. This does seem to make him an unlikely suspect.
