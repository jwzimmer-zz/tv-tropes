Bob goes and does something crazy heroic, risking himself. Once the crisis is over, Alice rips into Bob with utmost anger. Eventually, she comes out and admits she was worried about him. This frequently occurs in the context of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterActionPatchup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterActionPatchup">After-Action Patch-Up</a>. It can also happen in cases where the person has disappeared without communicating at all for a while, in which case it may be accompanied by, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingOutForNotCalling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingOutForNotCalling">You could have called!</a>"
</p><p>Of course, this trope can apply to either gender on both the giving and receiving end; it's the caring that brings it about that makes the trope. It is also particularly common for parents to show this trope when their children return from whatever world-saving adventure they've been on.
</p><p>Related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowDareYouDieOnMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowDareYouDieOnMe">How Dare You Die on Me!</a>, except it's milder, as in, "how dare you put yourself in so much danger." May also involve a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapSlapKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapSlapKiss">Slap-Slap-Kiss</a> or lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingOutForNotCalling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingOutForNotCalling">Calling Out for Not Calling</a>. Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearfulSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearfulSmile">Tearful Smile</a>, which occurs when Alice is still distraught even when she's happy. Good odds for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Punchy Love</a>-type to be this if they are far enough on the "punchy" side.

Since this trope is a requirement for all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsunderes</a>, expect a lot of the character archetype in the examples below...
<ul><li> Bulma from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> franchise tends to express her fears and worries for the protagonists' safety with eruptive rage. Goku, Vegeta, and especially Yamcha were the most common targets. A good example can be seen <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP5gI7zAEGg">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> This is what happens at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a>: The Second Raid</em>, although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> Kaname Chidori was afraid not only for Sousuke (who disappeared without a word in the middle of the series) but also for herself (since villains are constantly after her, and Sousuke was supposed to protect her). The progression of fear to relief to anger causes her to deliver an <em>epic</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan">Get A Hold Of Yourself Man</a> beatdown to Sousuke - himself in the throes of a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> - when they're finally reunited.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> played with this one in the Leliel/Dirac sea episode. Asuka is clearly aiming for the trope, but she keeps having to take a number as first Misato and then Rei "butt in" after Shinji reappears. She's left at a low simmer, but Shinji sees her the second time and seems to understand. Notably this is the only time we ever see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEeyore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEeyore">Shinji</a> laugh.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub">Ouran High School Host Club</a></em>, Tamaki calls Haruhi an idiot for trying to take on a group of bullies by herself and nearly getting killed in the process. The rest of the episode has Haruhi and Tamaki giving each other the silent treatment until they make up near the end.
<ul><li> Also in <em>Ouran</em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyTwins">Creepy Twins</a> Hikaru and Kaoru pull this off in the vacation episode to score <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">Moe</a> points through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twincest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twincest">twincest</a> subtext. Whether it was intentional or not is up to debate. Though in general, Hikaru is much more prone to this trope compared to the more level-headed Kaoru whenever there's actual conflict regarding them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> goes to town with this. With only a few exceptions, Sakura always worries about Naruto's safety in a combat situation. This persists despite him proving his skills over and over, and her insistence that she genuinely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">doesn't feel that way about him</a>.
<ul><li> Possibly the best example is from Chapter 450 when Naruto returns after defeating Pain, Sakura punches him for being so reckless, then embraces him, thanking him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He did not hug her back, which, in retrospect, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">foreshadowed</a> what was to come <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">nineteen chapters later</a>...</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rin also seems to have felt this for Obito, as he would always try to act tough and hide his wounds from her, which greatly annoyed her.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AceOfTheDiamond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AceOfTheDiamond">Ace of the Diamond</a></em>, Takashima-sensei finds out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">Miyuki</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has been hiding a serious abdominal injury since the semifinals of the Fall Tournament, and <em>immediately</em> gets <em>extremely</em> mad at him for endangering himself and risking long-term damage</span>. It's about the only time in the Anime that she audibly raises her voice.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu">Princess Tutu</a></em>, Fakir constantly treats Mytho harshly and orders him around. When Mytho begins to finally grow a backbone and stand up for himself, Fakir starts getting so distressed that his harsh demeanor escalates until he finally snaps and slaps Mytho. At first it's played to show him as a control freak, but it's soon revealed that he's really a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> and he's <em>terrified</em> of Mytho getting hurt because of past experiences. (He just has a very, very poor way of expressing himself when he's upset.)
</li><li> Chilchuck of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon">Delicious in Dungeon</a></em> gets pretty damn pissed off at <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Laios's insistence on continuing deeper into the dungeon, despite the party being very worn down in every possible sense after the fight with the Lunatic Magician.</span> However it's obvious, Chilchuck is simply worried about losing his friends.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Inuyasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Inuyasha">Inuyasha</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kagome breaks down into tears when she thinks Inuyasha's dead, calling him "Idiot!" When Inuyasha shows up alive and well, she yells at him, causing him to think that she's mad at him at first before she says that she's just so relieved that he's alive.
</li><li> In the anime, a similar scene has Kagome yelling some more at him because she's embarrassed at having broken down in tears.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Kagome</strong>: I'm not crying because I'm sad! I'M CRYING BECAUSE I FEEL HUMILIATED!
</div><ul><li> And another after the defeat of the Thunder Brothers. When Inuyasha sees Shippo and Kagome surrounded in foxfire, and thinks they're ghosts.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>:
<ul><li> Akane is wracked with worry over Ranma going to fight their first bonafide <em>lethal</em> opponent, who had locked him as a woman permanently. When he finally comes back, manhood restored (well, unlocked, anyway) he sneaks into the bathroom before greeting her. When she sees him, she's very obviously relieved to the point of tears, even as she's angry at him that he didn't go see her first.
</li><li> Shortly afterwards, Akane is the one who faces a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Orochi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Orochi">legendary eight-headed dragon</a> to repay a life debt, without asking for Ranma's help. After she's nearly killed, and Ranma rescues her, he berates her (albeit gently) for making him worry.
</li><li> After Shampoo and Akane have their first physical fight in the series, Ranma finds Akane unconscious on the grass. Thinking she might be dead, he urges her to wake up. When she does, he looks relieved, right before he promptly calls her an idiot and reprimands her for fighting Shampoo.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Audioplay/StrikersSoundStageX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Audioplay/StrikersSoundStageX">StrikerS Sound Stage X</a></em>, Nove has this reaction when a <a class="urllink" href="http://s5.photobucket.com/albums/y191/Liinna/Nanoha/random/SSX_Booklet_14-15.jpg">severely wounded Subaru<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> meets up with her after fighting her way out of some ruins.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSnarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSnarkKnight">Chisame</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> delivers one to Negi <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after he risks his life trying to study Evangeline's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">Black Magic</a></span>. For all the chaos he has (unintentionally) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCallKnowsWhereYouLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCallKnowsWhereYouLive">brought upon her</a>, she still cares about him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">more than she's willing to admit</a>.
<ul><li> Asuna does this to him quite often too.
</li></ul></li><li> Miaka goes through a mild version of this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi">Fushigi Yuugi</a></em> the first time Tamahome <em>really</em> risks his life saving her.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds">7 Seeds</a></em>: This is basically <em>the</em> meaning behind Semimaru's yelling. Since he made himself to be a tough guy, admitting that he was really worried in a heartfelt way would be too embarrassing, he opts to yell at people who made him worry. Particularly Arashi or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingBully">towards Natsu</a>.
</li><li> Happens in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">G Gundam</a></em> involving Rain and Domon.
</li><li> Anemone from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven">Eureka Seven</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who has only just realized she is in love with Dominic when he leaves around the same time, goes to save him when she accidentally attacks him with her mech while he's falling from the sky, clinging to a ref board to try and save her. She admonishes him for doing something so reckless, even though they're <em>both</em> in a freefall at this point. Now she's normally been pretty harsh on poor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoggedNiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoggedNiceGuy">Dominic</a> until now, but fortunately for him, she lets it slide. Cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigDamnKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigDamnKiss">The Big Damn Kiss</a></span>.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiHime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiHime">Mai Hime</a> side novel "Natsuki no Prelude," after Natsuki returns to school after her first battle with an Orphan, covered in wounds, Shizuru is quite shocked to see her hurt, and (not being a Hime at the time) tells her that if falling off her motorcycle caused it, she will keep her away from it even if she has to hit her. Natsuki insists that she's all right, but is touched that Shizuru cares about her.

<ul><li> Throughout the show, Matt shows himself to be very protective of Karen. On a few occasions where she goes off on her own and does something dangerous, Matt gets mad at her because he's scared that she could have gotten hurt.
<ul><li> In "Stick", two of Wilson Fisk's men jump Karen after she visits Elena Cardenas. She is saved when Foggy shows up and takes them both down with his softball bat. At the beginning of the next episode "Shadows in the Glass," Matt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">lectures Karen on her recklessness</a>.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Karen Page:</strong> No, I-I trust Ben as much as I do you or Foggy, Matt. I know what I am doing. I am not some kid! <br/><strong>Matt Murdock:</strong> Then don't act like one! Both of you. I know you're just trying to do the right thing here, but we have to be smart about this. <br/><strong>Foggy Nelson:</strong> We? <br/><strong>Matt Murdock:</strong> First rule, no more skulking around, asking to get hurt. We do this, it's gonna be on our turf. The legal system. <br/><strong>Karen Page:</strong> You know, that's not nearly as heroic as you might think- <br/><strong>Matt Murdock:</strong> I don't want anyone to be a hero, Karen!

So, what's the second rule? <br/><strong>Matt Murdock:</strong> ...I don't know, I'm making this up as I go along.
</div><ul><li> In "Penny and Dime", Karen slips out of the office and secretly breaks into Frank Castle's house, taking with her a photograph of Frank and his family. The next morning, in "Kinbaku", when she tells the guys about her little investigation, they're both angry at her; Foggy because she committed illegal activity, while Matt because she could have been hurt. Once Foggy leaves the conversation, Karen apologizes to Matt for pushing too far, but Matt calmly says, "I don't think you're wrong about Castle. But, its really simple, Karen. I dont want you to get hurt." This scene is an interesting parallel to the aforementioned scene from "Shadows in the Glass" because its the same configuration with the same characters and, once again, Karen is the bold one. The one difference is that even though Matt is upset, he more openly admits its because hes afraid something bad could happen to Karen. He felt the same as in that previous moment, but its even stronger here because, after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticRain">their kiss in the rain the night before</a>, he now knows he has deep feelings for her.
</li></ul></li><li> Foggy is pissed at Matt once he learns that Matt is the Devil of Hell's Kitchen, and his anger stems from different things. First is his obvious anger at the fact that Matt's kept a big secret hidden from him for the five years that they've been friends. Second is the fact that Matt is proving himself a great hypocrite, preaching about going after people through the legal system then beating the shit out of strangers. But third of all is the fact that Foggy is afraid that one day, Matt's going to get himself killed. For a good example of this, when Matt's recuperating on his couch from a concussion after Frank Castle shoots him in the head (the bullet is stopped by Matt's helmet), Foggy isn't lecturing him about his activities but about the fact that Matt came that close to dying. Given Matt seemingly is killed in Midland Circle during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDefenders2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDefenders2017">The Defenders (2017)</a></em>, Foggy's fears are not unfounded.

She takes a harsher tone, though, when Matt tells her that the Hand may know that he is Daredevil, because this is incredibly reckless of Matt to do and Karen doesn't want him to get hurt or all the work they did to put away Wilson Fisk get undone.
