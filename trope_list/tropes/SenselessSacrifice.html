It's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">downer</a> counterpart to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, because rather than kill the bad guy, fulfill the prophecy, or allow the other survivors to escape alive... it <em>doesn't.</em> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> survived the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructiveCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructiveCharge">Self-Destructive Charge</a>, the prophecy actually meant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a> would <em>start</em> with a selfless sacrifice, and the boat the survivors escaped on <em>has no fuel</em>.

What needs to happen is that the previously "senseless" sacrifice was actually either a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> on the martyr's part to create an exploitable weakness for the hero to use later, or doing so by sheer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">dumb luck</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AkameGaKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AkameGaKill">Akame ga Kill!</a></em> Tatsumi is in his battle suit when he stops a giant robot to rescue several people who would have been killed if he fell upon them. In this action, however, he is killed. An episode later, Esdeath kills these people along with some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy">revolutionary army red shirts</a>.
</li><li> Deconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>. While the story acknowledges that sometimes one person's death can save many lives, it also tears into the idea of self-sacrifice as ennobling someone at all. There is no such thing as a dignified death (because being eaten by a Titan is an utterly nightmarish way to die), and anyone who tries to sacrifice themselves for the sake of others gets quickly outed as a narcissistic wastrel: essentially, they want to be remembered as brave heroes while taking the coward's way out.
<ul><li> A rare inversion occurs in chapter 50 where Hannes protects Eren and Mikasa and dies in the process, but his death is the main catalyst for the activation of Eren's new power.
<ul><li> The very existence of the Survey Corps is a subversion. Yes, excursions are basically throwing mud at the wall and hoping something sticks with every throw costing about a hundred lives, but even before wall Maria was breached humanity's prospects were so bad getting a hundred people killed on the off chance they get a hold of something important was worth it. Best case, they find something to stop the titans, worst case, fewer mouths to feed.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> During the Eclipse in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>, both Pippin and Judeau make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifices</a> to save Casca from getting killed and eaten by the ravening demons after Griffith marks them and everyone else with the Brand of Sacrifice. While Casca does escape a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">Cruel and Unusual Death</a> at the hands of the demons and ends up one of the only two survivors thanks to their heroic efforts, she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">ends up suffering</a> an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama">equally horrific ordeal</a> when Femto, Griffith reborn as the fifth member of the Godhand, gets his hands on her, ultimately resulting in her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">losing her mind</a> (as well as having the child that she made with Guts prior to the Eclipse corrupted by Femto's rape) despite Guts' best efforts to save her.
</li><li> Jushiro Ukitake in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> is one of the oldest Captains in the story, having been around for centuries (for scale, he was a Captain in the days of George Washington!). One of his defining characteristics is his chronic lung disease that prevents him from doing much most of the time. This prevents what would otherwise be one of the strongest characters in the whole series from ever having a serious one-on-one fight through the whole series. It turns out that all of his time as a Shinigami was borrowed time. He should have died when he was three years old, but his parents made a deal with a deity that also happened to be the right hand of the Soul King. The deity, Mimihagi, would keep his disease at bay and thus him alive, but in exchange, he would one day give his life to Mimihagi. When Ichigo unintentionally kills the Soul King, reality itself starts to collapse. Ukitake, knowing it is time, invokes the ritual to release Mimihagi, intending to become the new Soul King. He manages to buy everyone about 10 seconds of stability before Ywhach assimilates Mimihagi, becoming the Soul King himself and killing Ukitake in the process.
</li><li> Near the end of the fourth event in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BofuriIDontWantToGetHurtSoIllMaxOutMyDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BofuriIDontWantToGetHurtSoIllMaxOutMyDefense">BOFURI: I Don't Want to Get Hurt, so I'll Max Out My Defense</a></em>, Mii tries to take a weakened Maple out by using a self-destruct skill. Not only did Maple survive, but Yui and May were in top shape (though inexperienced). Mii lampshades this at the post-event party when highlight clips of the battle are shown.

Unfortunately the girl, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Tokiko</a>, was a warrior from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatureHunterOrganization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatureHunterOrganization">Creature-Hunter Organization</a> who was attempting to lure the homunculus into a trap and was in no danger whatsoever.
</li><li> In the second episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a> R2</em>, Urabe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructMechanism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructMechanism">self-destructs</a> his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Knightmare Frame</a> in order to defeat the seemingly-invincible opponent Knightmare (or, at the very least, to buy time for Zero and Kallen to get away from it).

Anyone who gets mortally wounded in the game is deleted and the only ones left are Conan, Ran, and a random rich kid. Ran has just been captured by the in-game Big Bad and a showdown between him and Conan begins on top of a moving train that is going out of control. Ran, remembering Shin'ichi words, decides to save the two boys by jumping off the train into the abyss, deleting herself and taking the big bad with her.

Too bad that's exactly what happened a few episodes later. To make matters worse, the gate he did manage to seal is one that would have been useful for the heroes to have open once that happened!
</li><li> Happens <strong>all</strong> the time in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>: Mutenroshi (who later, in the Saiyan arc, openly admits that such losses are both senseless and tragic) and Chiaotzu against King Piccolo, Chiaotzu <em>again</em> and Tenshinhan against Nappa, Vegeta against Majin Buu, and Krillin against Majin Buu (though it does help Mr. Popo to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">save Dende</a> before he's killed). Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">it's Dragon Ball</a>, so they all get better, but still.
<ul><li> Android 16 didn't, sadly. His plan to bear hug Cell and just blow the living daylights out of him failed when it was revealed that his self-destruct mechanism was removed when Bulma reconstructed him. And by the look on Cell's eyes, it might, <em>might</em> have worked had he pulled it off. Although future developments (i.e. Cell regenerating from a planet-destroying blast and coming back even stronger) suggest that this attempt was, sadly, <em>very</em> likely to have failed anyway.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>. When 16 was broken apart, he could still theoretically be repaired, but then he had Mr. Satan throw his head towards Gohan and Cell, and arranged for Cell to squash his head, to inspire Gohan to attain the next Super Saiyan level.
</li></ul></li><li> Goku pulled one off against Cell too, by teleporting to King Kai's planet with him shortly after Cell decided to self-destruct. Cell's core survived, allowing him to regenerate, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackStrong">become even stronger</a> thanks to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegoGenetics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegoGenetics">Saiyan genes</a>, and Cell went <em>right back to Earth</em> to menace it anew. It's not completely senseless, though; Goku <em>did</em> save Earth. Though you could argue that, had he spent less time talking, he could've teleported Cell, grabbed King Kai, and teleported back before Cell exploded.
<ul><li> Which means that even if 16's original plan had worked, the outcome would've likely remained the same, except that 16 wouldn't have been around to inspire Gohan.
</li><li> If you count the movies, this also caused a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!</a> by freeing a certain nasty space pirate.
</li></ul></li><li> It's practically a running gag at this point. In fact, quite possibly the only time a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a> has ever worked in the franchise is the Saibaman blowing up Yamcha - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticLoser">which is kinda depressing for Yamcha</a>, when you think about it.
</li></ul></li><li> In the manga version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em>, doomed clumsy girl Kisaragi is informed by Kurama that she must be sacrificed in order to kill Lucy, who has taken her hostage. She agrees to this readily, owing to her deep feelings for her boss. Arguably, the anime, wherein Lucy simply kills her ASAP, leaving a dumb look on the poor girl's floating severed head, owns the shock value. But when Lucy is able to use her hostage's death to confuse things just enough to help ensure her escape, she does not hesitate to taunt the hell out of Kurama, stating "Her Death Was Useless!" Though Kisaragi's death <em>does</em> inspire Kurama not to try sacrifice anyone else to stop Lucy. This ends up saving Nana's life later.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>, legendary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson">ice mage</a> Ur sacrifices her life (sort of) to seal the demon Deliora in unbreakable, unmeltable ice for eternity. Since Deliora was a rampaging beast of destruction, that seems awfully noble of her—until you recall that the <em>reason</em> she did this was to snap one of her two pupils out of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason">Revenge Before Reason</a> obsession. It worked—only for the <em>other</em> pupil to head down a similarly destructive path after her sacrifice. Many, <em>many</em> chapters later, it actually helps out. Ultear, her true daughter, finds out that her mother has become one with the ice and can reconcile with her due to being separated for genetic experiments and the scientists lying to Ur's face that her daughter was dead.

After Wrath wounds him and he realizes that he cannot fight him for much longer, he rips off his shirt to reveal four explosives and lunges at Wrath to kill them both... but Wrath just slices the fuses off of the explosives with his sword, rendering them harmless and slicing open Fu's belly in the process. Buccaneer, who had already been fatally wounded, seizes the opportunity and stabs Wrath <em>through</em> Fu, taking advantage of the one blind spot in Wrath's otherwise perfect vision to seriously injure him.
</li><li> This occurs earlier when Roa and Dolcetto <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShallNotPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShallNotPass">attempt to hold off Wrath so Greed can escape</a>. They're cut down instantly, and Wrath moves on to Greed.

Rather than simply wait for Mitsukake, who could have cleared up his injuries with a touch, he decides to use the last of his strength to move a huge boulder and dies of the strain. The reason it's a Senseless Sacrifice? <em>The boulder isn't actually blocking the cave entrance it's in front of</em>. There's enough room to just <em>walk around it</em>.

<ul><li> This is performed by the elite guards of Arabasta who drank the <em>hero water</em> (a drink that makes you incredibly powerful at cost of killing you in 5 minutes) just to save the princess from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. He just stood on the rooftop of the palace and waited until they died, unwilling to fight against them just because they did it.
</li><li> A non-lethal, comical variant, where if Luffy fell into the water, Chopper, followed by Brook, would jump in to rescue him, forgetting that they are also Devil Fruit users and cannot swim either. Zoro or another crewmate usually saves them each time.
</li><li> Another non-lethal, but less comical, version happens in the Water Seven arc. As the Sea Train is heading towards Enies Lobby with Franky and Nico Robin, the two people who can revive the ancient weapon Pluton (Franky has the blueprints while Robin can read Poneglyphs), Franky joins up with Sanji and "Sogeking"/Usopp to save Robin, who's held at the front of the train. Since they can't defeat the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CP9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CP9">CP 9</a> agents guarding her, Franky opts to separate the engine and front car from the rest of the train while said agents are in the former and Sanji, Robin and Sogeking are in the latter. As Franky demonstrates later, he has the blueprints on his person and can destroy them if necessary, so in theory, this would result in <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CP9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CP9">CP 9</a> leaving empty-handed. Unfortunately, Blueno's Devil Fruit powers enable him to create a door bridging the gap between the two cars, allowing him to take Robin back. In the end, Franky's sacrifice to save Robin only resulted in <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CP9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CP9">CP 9</a> temporarily escaping with both of them.
</li><li> A non-lethal but still played for tragic occurrence is during the Sabaody arc, when Hachi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">throws himself in front of Luffy to save Luffy from being shot in the back by Saint Charloss</a>. The problem is... Luffy is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan">Rubber Man</a>, and thusly immune to bullets, so all Hachi achieved was to get himself hurt for nothing. Oh, and to make Luffy so mad that he punched out Saint Charloss, calling down the wrath of Admiral Kizaru on his crew.

The original plan was to try and get Sayaka to revert back to herself by using Madoka, her best friend. They quickly find out that no, Sayaka isn't in that monster and starts attacking them. Kyoko sacrifices herself so that Madoka and Homura can escape. We later find out that this plan was set in motion by Kyubey, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTellALie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTellALie">cunningly employed half-truths</a> to let Kyoko believe that Sayaka could be saved (which, in actuality, was hopeless). Now that all of the other magical girls are dead, Homura is the only one who can fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Walpurgis Night,</a> the ultimate witch who cannot be defeated by a single magical girl. And so now, what will Madoka have to do that Homura has been trying to prevent the whole series in order to save her home?

Unfortunately, when she arrives, she doesn't care about the humans and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">attempts to escape</a> when confronted by the demons, only to be quickly killed.

After two of them die, Hao casually reveals he was just using the oxygen in the surrounding air, and didn't see it as a weakness at all. The last of them tries to snuff out all the oxygen in the immediate area by using an incendiary, but Hao's other abilities render this pointless.
</li><li> The death of Domel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato2199" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato2199">Space Battleship Yamato 2199</a></em>. He blows himself up to take down the <em>Yamato</em> for the purpose of giving his men's deaths a sense... And the <em>Yamato</em> manages to reactivate the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields">wave motion shields</a> just in time, surviving the explosion with a scratched paint job.

It's not <em>entirely</em> pointless, but it only reveals the strengths and weaknesses of Haou, Judai's superpowered evil side so that O'Brien can make a proper heroic sacrifice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em> opens with a senseless sacrifice by the main character. It appears as though he saved a child from being run over, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimReaper">Grim Reaper</a> later remarks that the car would have veered out of the way if not for the confusion of Yusuke jumping into the street to push the child out of the way.

</div></dd></dl><ul><li> Subverted, however, in that while the sacrifice was useless in its intended purpose, it ultimately allowed Yusuke to turn his life around (once he got it <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">back</a>,</em> of course). It also gave him the opportunity to come back in the first place. The powers that be never expected someone like Yusuke to save a kid at the cost of his own life, so he wasn't supposed to die at that time. It's the only reason Yusuke was given the chance to earn a resurrection.

Sadly, his death was for nothing, as his son would continue his research, and in the years that followed up to the present, the Sentinels would practically become symbolic for anti-mutant hate. Even worse, Trask was resurrected relatively recently by Bastion, who hoped to make him part of a new anti-mutant team, and learned, to his horror, that his creations had since caused the deaths of <em>16 million</em> mutants, a revelation that drove him to suicide.

However, Gordon winds up getting killed almost immediately after the villains have been defeated anyway, crushed by falling rubble when he triggers the explosives in the Batcave roof to stop the monster that Batman has become.
<ul><li> This arguably also applies to Catwoman's sacrifice in <em>Bloodstorm</em>, the second book in the trilogy; <em>Crimson Mist</em> revealed that staking on its own just immobilises the vampire unless they're decapitated, so there was no need for Selina to sacrifice herself to save Batman from the Joker's crossbow arrow, as she could have just let the bolt hit him, taken out the Joker, and then pulled the bolt out of Batman's chest.

</li><li> The 2008 Japanese film <em>For Those We Love</em>, which, like <em>The Eternal Zero</em> gives focus on the kamikaze pilots, this time from the perspective of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service.

The two pilots that do manage to get past these obstacles manage to hit a Destroyer Escort and Aircraft Carrier, respectively.

When it looks like Will is going to lose, Will's father makes an absurdly high bet so that Jones calls him out instead (at the same cost). Though noble, this turns out to have been a bad idea for two reasons. One, Will didn't care whether he won or lost, the main goal of the game was to trick Jones into revealing where he hid the key. Two, though this is never addressed in the film itself, observant viewers will notice that Jones had five fives and Will had three. Will had bet eight fives, which means that if Bootstrap hadn't intervened and Jones had called him out instead, Will would have won.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>:

Turns out he's one of the few beings in existence it can't kill.
<ul><li> In another episode foreshadowing these events, Dean is sent to the future by Zachariah to meet his future self after turning down Michael. Future-Dean turns out to have become such a hate-filled, heartless bastard, that he gets many of his present good friends killed just to get close to now Lucifer-inhabited-Sam with the Colt. Apparently, he doesn't even get the chance to shoot the gun before he's killed, making Cas and the others' death completely pointless, even for the present-Dean, who doesn't understand that <em>even if he got a shot, it still wouldn't do any good</em>. Then the Ellen/Jo thing happens.
</li><li> To be fair, Ellen and Jo did assure Sam and Dean's escape from there. On the other hand, if they did die (and they did a lot), they'd just be brought back.
</li><li> In the Season Twelve finale, Crowley and Castiel die fighting Lucifer, and they seem to be open to this criticism. Basically, they are trying to keep Lucifer from passing through a portal that leads from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherDimension">Another Dimension</a> to our world, so that he will be trapped there forever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">(or as long as possible)</a>. Lucifer gets through the portal anyway, but Mary pushes him back in so that Lucifer and Mary are the ones who are both trapped in the alternate dimension. It seems that Mary's sacrifice was the one that was really effective, while Castiel and Crowley both died without quite making the real difference between victory and defeat for their side. Furthermore, Lucifer returns in the following season, although Castiel's death <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">is not permanent</a>.

Not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidSacrifice">Stupid Sacrifice</a> because his motivation makes sense. It seemed almost inevitable that even this would go terribly wrong, as not one good thing happens to him in the entire miniseries.
<ul><li> On the other hand, his death inspires his assistant to team up with Torchwood to expose the corrupt Prime Minister (the one that ordered Frobisher to give up his own kids so that the administration could show themselves to be victims as well in the aftermath) who would otherwise have gotten away with betraying Britain and the entire Earth by willingly sacrificing the children under the guise of trying to protect them.

</li><li> Early in the game's history, there were several Level 5 and higher monsters that had lower attack and defense stats than the strongest Level 4 monsters, and effects back in those days were rare. This meant that you threw away a fair-to-average monster in order to get a weaker one. This was an attempt at balance since lower level monsters might have one good stat and one bad one, while higher level ones were more average on both. In the end, you were better off with one good stat.

</li><li> An odd example where this is part of the <em>gameplay</em> can be found in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>. The moves Selfdestruct and Explosion do a lot of damage but render the user unconscious. This can be useful if you have other teammates, but if you have no other battle-ready Pokémon left on your team, it's an instant loss. Despite this, wild Pokémon will still use them for no apparently in-universe reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitefulAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitefulAI">by spite</a> (the real reason being that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIRoulette">wild Pokémon have no AI and just choose attacks randomly</a>).
<ul><li> Much worse is the fact that Team Rocket is fond of using Pokemon that know Self-Destruct. The Grunts often send out a single Koffing and immediately order it to Self-Destruct. If they're lucky, this will knock out one of the player's six Pokemon.
</li><li> What could possibly make the use of a move like Selfdestruct even <em>more</em> pointless, you ask? How about if the opposing Pokémon is ghost-type? Since Selfdestruct and Explosion are both normal-type moves they will completely fail to affect ghost type Pokémon, while still killing the user.

They're known for instigating events that hurtle entire sub-sectors (groupings of a few to dozens of planets, each inhabited by billions of humans or more) to their doom in order to prolong the lives of a few hundred of their own. So, come <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a></em>, its expansions and sequels, it can pretty well be summed up that any Eldar force you take down is committing this trope, especially if they're working on an end result that would probably work out better in the end if they would just think about the fact that the "primitive humans" might actually win. To whit: the Farseer's <em>entire plan</em> in Dawn Of War 2.
<ul><li> With information gained from the Eldar campaign <em>Retribution</em>, the plan does make a little more sense. The Eldar's objective in the sector is the retrieval a soulstones within a craftworld that crashed on Typhon aeons ago.

The conflict between the quarians and the geth has come to a head, and if you lack the resources or drive to bring them to peaceful coexistence, you must choose one race or the other, with the one not chosen being utterly annihilated. At game's end, if you pick the "Destroy" ending, all synthetic life is wiped out. So if you side with the geth and then pick "Destroy", congratulations, you just committed pointless genocide on two sentient species.
</li><li> A canonical-in-all-stories example <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">seemingly</a> occurs with the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MassEffectParagonLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MassEffectParagonLost">Paragon Lost</a></em>, which details James Vega's life prior to joining the <em>Normandy</em>. During a Collector attack on Fehl Prime, he is faced with a difficult decision: he has gathered some extremely useful intelligence on the Collectors, which will be instrumental in the Alliance counterattacking them, but to secure it, he has to sacrifice all of the colonists of Fehl Prime, whom he has gotten to know over the past two years.

</li><li> The death of Admiral Zaal'Koris in <em>Mass Effect 3</em> is potentially this: if you do not save him he sacrifices himself to save the lives of his civilian crew, but depending on other factors, his death can make it impossible to make peace between the quarians and the geth, thus potentially leading to the extinction of his entire species - including the ones he died to protect.
</li><li> Yet another example, also in <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, can come as a result of player choices if Samara survived the previous game. Since the Justicar Code obligates her to kill the sole survivor of the Ardat-Yakshi monastery (who happens to be her daughter Falere), Samara attempts to kill herself so she wouldn't have to kill Falere instead. The player has the choice whether to intervene or not, or a particularly sadistic player can wait until Samara shoots herself, and then <em>kill Falere anyway</em>, making Samara's suicide completely pointless.

A madness that would last until one person was killed and then fade until the next time. Arcadia's Keeper, Ivan, spent his life trying to find a way to break the cycle. In old age, he decided to try sacrificing himself, making himself the one death; an act that was forbidden. When the day came, he slit his wrists in the town square as the madness came over him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">At first</a>, it looked like he succeeded, but the madness came over everyone yet again. This time, however, it didn't end with one person's death and Ivan lived just long enough to see everyone in Arcadia kill each other.

They never found Appa in the HQ which was what Jet's sacrifice was meant to do, buy them time. Not to mention the Dai Li aren't taken down either. Though Jet's death is less of a sacrifice and more just getting killed.

She returns in a later episode revealing that even SHE is still alive back in Queen mode. The sacrifice itself was entirely pointless.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDragonPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDragonPrince">The Dragon Prince</a></em> shows in the first season Callum how he meets the elven assassin Rayla in the castle. She and the other assassins have bound themselves with magical bracelets that will not fall off until they have killed King Harrow and Prince Ezran. Callum pretends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmSpartacus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmSpartacus">to be his half-brother Ezran</a> so she spares him and kills Callum in his place. Fortunately, Rayla is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinionWithAnFInEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinionWithAnFInEvil">kind-hearted</a> elf, and spares him. One of the other assassins would probably have killed Callum immediately. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">However, the bracelet would not have fallen off and he would have recognized the lie and then started looking for the real Prince Ezran</a>. To be fair, Callum couldn't know how the magical bracelets of the elves work.
<ul><li> In the second season, King Harrow goes on an expedition to get the heart of a magma titan, because the magician Viren can use this to cast a spell to save the country from famine. On the way back they are attacked by a giant dragon. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShallNotPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShallNotPass">Viren stays behind to ward him off</a>, and Queen Sarai realizes that Viren shouldn't happen because he's the only one who can cast the spell and the whole mission was otherwise in vain. As a result, she saves Viren and is killed herself by the dragon.
</li><li> In the third season Callum and Rayla have arrived at the nest of the dragon queen. When they hear that a large army is on the way to this nest and that the situation is hopeless, Callum wants to flee. However, Rayla wants to stay behind. She knows that she won't survive the arrival of the army, but she wants to make amends for the shame her parents have caused. In fact, there is an dispute between the two because Callum considers she selfish and accuses her of the senselessness of this sacrifice. However, after finding out that her parents were heroes, Rayla abandons the plan and the lovers reconcile again.

Cody II is completely nonplussed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em>, Macbeth had a Senseless Sacrifice in his flashbacks; after he was officially killed by Canmore and his son Luach took his crown, he realized that Luach's only hope of defeating Canmore was if Macbeth himself remained officially dead. The end result:
<div class="indent"><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Did your own death save your son Luach from Canmore? <br/><strong>Macbeth:</strong> No.

<ul><li> Mako, in the finale, came this close to making one. He and Bolin were tasked with destroying Kuvira's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> power core while Lin and Suin went after the weapon. Mako knew that the exploding core would likely kill him. And barely survived due to a lot of luck. However, by that time, Lin had already thoroughly demolished walker's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>, rendering it harmless.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ShadowRaiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ShadowRaiders">Shadow Raiders</a></em> is a rather grim kids' show.
<ul><li> By episode 20 the Beast had already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetEater">eaten three inhabited planets</a> <em>on screen,</em> two of them belonging to the protagonists! While the inhabitants of planet Fire managed to evacuate, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">not evil at all vizier</a> crashed the planet into the Beast to no effect. Planet Jungle chose to sacrifice itself since it could not escape and again did no visible damage.
</li><li> And then, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, the Beast is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation">teleported</a> away from Planet Rock]] at the last second by driving the Prison Planet into its maw and having its World Engine take them both to the far reaches of the galaxy. The last scene of the series, after all the triumphant cheering and congratulating, is of the Beast devouring another inhabited planet, with the heavy implication that it has assimilated the Prison Planet's teleportation technology.
</li><li> Let's not forget Planet Water, which the entire planet was turned into one massive cannon putting everything it had in one shot (which killed everyone on it), doesn't even dent the Beast.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em> has a few examples:

While it is certainly heroic that he was willing to try, that hallway was a deathtrap and even a Jedi would have had trouble running that gauntlet. His death ultimately accomplished nothing, though his life certainly mattered.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS4E4ShadowWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS4E4ShadowWarrior">"Shadow Warrior"</a>, General Tarpals' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> in defeating and capturing Grievous and dying in the process turns into this because they end up having to give Grievous back to the Separatists in exchange for Anakin Skywalker, who was captured by Dooku shortly after Grievous' capture.
</li><li> Really, the entire Clone Wars conflict is one big Senseless Sacrifice. Every gain, every loss, every hard-fought battle, every trooper who gives his life to the cause, every Jedi who dies from the first Battle of Geonosis onwards...turns out to have happened totally in vain when it's revealed that the entire conflict was engineered by Palpatine, masterfully controlling both sides for his own ends.
</li></ul></li><li> In the second season premiere of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)</a></em>, when the Turtles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">accidentally drop the Kraang's shipment of mutagen all over New York</a>, April is mesmerized by the falling canisters and almost gets hit by one before Kirby rushes in to save her and ends up getting hit with it himself, becoming the show's first incarnation of Wingnut. What makes this senseless is that it later turns out April was immune to the mutagen's effects anyway.
</li><li> In the second season finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em>, when the Decepticons launch a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs">full-scale assault on the Autobot base</a>, Optimus orders the humans and other 'Bots to evacuate through the GroundBridge, while he stays behind to destroy the controls so that the 'Cons can't come after them. However, what makes this senseless is the fact that moments later, Megatron uses the <em>Nemesis</em>' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> to obliterate the entire mountain, destroying not just the Bridge, but seemingly Optimus in the process.
<ul><li> It's Optimus, though. He sacrifices himself all the time. On occasion, it'll be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidSacrifice">Stupid Sacrifice</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Trollhunters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Trollhunters">Trollhunters</a></em>, Angor Rot seizes Morgana and holds her so that Jim can impale them both with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword">Daylight</a>, only for them to discover that while Angor is mortally wounded, Morgana is too powerful to be killed by the weapon.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder16" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The battle of Peleliu was one of the longest and bloodiest battles of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">Pacific War</a>, lasting months and resulting in thousands of American and Japanese casualties. Yet the island was never used for anything important and the sacrifices made there very likely didn't shorten the war by so much as a day.
</li><li> Pops up when discussing the losing side of war quite a lot, especially if the winners allow the defeated to remain independent. For example, millions of Japanese soldiers and sailors gave their lives thinking that America would destroy Japan if their cause failed. Not only did this not happen, America even helped rebuild Japan into an economic powerhouse — although the defeat more or less put an end to Japan's military power.
<ul><li> The US and British took a very dim view of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack">Kamikaze tactics</a> the Japanese employed near the end of the war. While terrifying in concept, they did very little to slow the Allied fleets. Most of the "Special Attack" squadrons were shot down before reaching their target, while the <em>Banzai</em> charges just chewed through men on both sides. Granted, the strategy was meant to demoralize rather than stop them, but it's effectiveness was questionable at best. Even to this day, the word "Kamikaze" is a derisive term in the United States; synonymous with "Suicidal Nut-Job".
</li></ul></li><li> While this trope is a constant feature in the history of Poland, the ill-fated Warsaw Uprising of 1944 is probably the best example of it. Hearing of the imprisonment or execution of Home Army leaders by the Soviets upon their liberation of Lublin province, and the conscription of their troops into the Polish Army, Home Army leaders in Warsaw decided to try to liberate Warsaw by themselves so they could greet the Red Army as hosts. This would force the Soviets to actually fight the Home Army in order to get to them, which could make things very awkward for the Soviets politically. The remnants of the pre-war military dictatorship in London (the 'government-in-exile') had a much better grasp of the strategic situation and strongly counseled against rising up so soon because the German Army was nowhere close to being defeated, but they had no real power over their nominal 'subordinates' within Warsaw and were basically forced to approve their decision to rise up on the 1st of August. The result, near-total lack of support from the Soviets and a horribly one-sided defeat, was as unfortunate as it was avoidable: as the Government-in-exile had tried to point out repeatedly, the uprising had good chances of success if they'd just waited four months.
</li><li> During the Battle of the Philippine Sea in 1944, the Japanese carrier <em>Taihō</em> was torpedoed by the American submarine USS <em>Albacore</em>. One pilot who was taking off and saw the torpedoes dived its plane against one to stop it from hitting the ship. It was in vain since one torpedo hit the carrier and thanks to <em>very</em> poor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageControl">Damage Control</a> and design flaws ended sinking it.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Coronel">Battle of Coronel<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in World War I. A pair of British armored cruisers under command of Rear Admiral Cradock took on a pair much more modern and capable German armored cruisers under Vice Admiral von Spee, and the British ships were sunk with all hands lost. Cradock set sail without the old battleship <em>Canopus</em> (while slow, it was more powerful than both German cruisers combined and sufficiently armored to be impervious to their guns) he was told its engines were in poor shape, despite a direct order not to engage the Germans without it. It turned out later that there was nothing wrong with the battleship's engines, and the ship's engineer had simply gone insane. Knowing he had no chance of defeating the German ships, Cradock apparently hoped to cause damage to them and impair their commerce-raiding mission. But he managed only two hits, neither of which caused any damage. To make matters worse, Spee's cruisers were themselves wiped out a month later in <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Falkland_Islands">Battle of the Falklands<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by British battlecruisers in similarly one-sided battle, meaning that it made no difference at all whether Cradock could've inflicted some damage.
</li><li> Amateur chess players do this quite often, giving up a pawn or a piece (or even multiple pieces) in the hope of some kind of brilliant attack, only to end up not gaining anything and losing. Even professional players have been known to fall into this trap sometimes. Interestingly chess also contains a unique example of a forced senseless sacrifice. This occurs when a losing player already on the receiving end of a mating attack is in check. If the losing king can't hide, the losing player (if they don't resign) is forced to place a piece or rarely a pawn on an unsafe square in between the losing king and the attacking piece where the doomed piece or pawn will be captured with automatic checkmate if there is no more wood to "throw on the fire".
</li><li> When the Russians were planning to launch Soyuz 1 in 1967, their choices for a pilot were Vladimir Komarov and Yuri Gagarin. Both cosmonauts knew the spacecraft wasn't ready to be launched, but they were close friends and neither was willing to let the other go on what they knew would likely be a suicide mission. Eventually, Komarov went up in the vessel and was killed when the descent module's parachutes malfunctioned. Gagarin survived... only to die the following year in a plane crash.
