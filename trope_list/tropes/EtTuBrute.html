Yesterday's news. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap">Death Traps</a> to the left and right of them? Snore. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a>? They already know, thanks, and they're working on it. These characters know that a burden rests on their shoulders and don't let it get them down.
</p><p>There's only one thing that can bring a seemingly invincible character to their knees: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetrayalTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetrayalTropes">Betrayal</a>.
</p><p>Having the entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">evil empire</a> out to get them isn't a big deal as long as they have their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> watching their backs. But if one of the chosen few should renege, the hero will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">go to pieces</a>.
</p><p>It doesn't have to be anything as dramatic as switching sides or selling out to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. If one makes a few scathing comments about their leadership skills, or another holds the hero responsible for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CynicismCatalyst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CynicismCatalyst">Cynicism Catalyst</a>, the results can be as devastating as though they'd painted a target on their pal's head and handed out sniper rifles.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Can be played for comedy if their reaction is clearly an overreaction — surviving a cave in, an ambush, and a death trap without breaking a sweat, only to burst out into tears when his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenBirthday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenBirthday">girlfriend forgets his birthday</a>, for example. Generally it's anything but funny; most people can relate to having someone important let them down. Even if it's an overreaction it may reveal exactly how much stress the character is under.
</p><p>A second version of this trope is where the hero has already given their buddy a second chance, overlooking past (or even current) misdeeds in the interest of preserving the friendship and deciding to accept their pal just the way they are, warts and all... as long as their misdemeanors are confined to people who <em>aren't</em> the hero or their immediate family. Should that unspoken truce be broken, a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">Freak Out</a> is only seconds away.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>A third version of this trope comes when the hero or the villain develops a bond with someone, only to discover that the person in question <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFriend">was never his friend, and just pretended to be one</a>. Often followed by the obvious next question, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasItAllALie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasItAllALie">Was It All a Lie?</a>
</p><p>This is, of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> — the vast majority of us care <em>far</em> more about what our parents, friends, and family think than what Joe Bloggs down the street may say about us.
</p><p>Particularly brutal if the victim is betrayed by the ones who supposedly rescued him from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlessBackground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlessBackground">Friendless Background</a>, or if they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends">desperately seek friendship above all else</a>. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">Sadistic Choice</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakHisHeartToSaveHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakHisHeartToSaveHim">Break His Heart to Save Him</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseYouCanCope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseYouCanCope">Because You Can Cope</a> excuse may be made if the victim's "betrayer" felt as though they had no choice but to abandon them. If the characters in question were friends with each other prior to the betrayal, it probably triggers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilFormerFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilFormerFriend">Evil Former Friend</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends">We Used to Be Friends</a>. Compare and contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotMandatedFriendshipFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotMandatedFriendshipFailure">Plot-Mandated Friendship Failure</a>, where the friend merely leaves rather than outright betrays him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetrayalByOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetrayalByOffspring">Betrayal by Offspring</a> is similar except that the betrayal is done by a character's son or daughter.
</p><p>At the risk of stating the obvious, the trope namer is Julius Caesar's alleged response upon seeing Brutus, a man he treated like a son, among his attackers. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0xsox');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0xsox" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0xsox');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> While this was Shakespeare's version of Caesar's dying words, other sources say that he said, "And you, child?" or simply said nothing and stopped resisting. </span> "Et tu" means "and you."

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">End of Evangelion</a></em>, this is done twice (at least). In the past, when the first Dr. Naoko Akagi becomes the lover of Gendo Ikari, he instead callously betrays her by making a clone of his dead wife and makes it clear that she is not needed anymore. Heartbroken and enraged, she strangles the clone and then commits suicide by throwing herself from the control balcony. Years later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotScientist">Dr. Ritsuko Akagi</a> becomes <em>another</em> lover of Gendo, but she has rigged the MAGI computers to blow in hopes of killing Gendo in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> for <em>both</em> Akagis, only for her mother (in the programming of the MAGI system) to disable the bomb. Ritsuko is understandably devastated by this betrayal. Then, she is shot by Gendo. Yeesh, as if this show wasn't dark <em>enough</em>...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RivalTurnedEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RivalTurnedEvil">Sasuke Uchiha</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> has reduced many a protagonist to tears with his willingness to kill his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> in cold blood, including the eponymous one, who starts bawling like a little kid when he realized that his former best friend-slash-substitute-brother is serious about killing him. A special mention goes to him telling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">very useful</a>, deeply loyal teammate (who was also in love with him) who had just been taken hostage not to move - naturally, her expression relaxes into a blissful smile... and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">he stabs her along with her captor.</a>
<ul><li> Sasuke himself has it when he learned that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Hidden Leaf Village is truly responsible for the Uchiha Clan Massacre, giving him a reason of wanting to destroy it</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>: Nappa was willing to fight the much stronger Goku, until, of course, Vegeta betrayed him, and he was unable to do anything to defend himself.
<ul><li> This happens to Trunks and Goten; they were more than willing to fight Buu alongside Vegeta until he (apparently) offed Trunks (who was briefly shocked by his dad doing this to him), after which Goten entered a very brief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> after this before Vegeta took him out as well. Obviously, this was due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">Vegeta needing to be alone</a> to sacrifice himself against the monster he brought into this world.

The same happened to Misao (aka Pixy Misa); she ran away from her home and her school when she believed that she had betrayed her best friend.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KaleidoStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KaleidoStar">Kaleido Star</a></em>'s Sora puts up with a hell of a lot of grief in the second season — not that the first season was a picnic, but still. At various points in the storyline, she is demoted, fired, paired up with a partner who verges on sociopathic and spends the whole series struggling to earn the title of Kaleido Star — a title which she had won fair and square by the end of the first season, only to be usurped by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter">a newcomer who wields far more power than any newcomer to the troupe has a right to</a>. Through most of it, she remains perky and cheerful, convinced that everything will work out all right in the end... but when Layla, Sora's idol, suddenly turns on her and sides with Sora's rival, the poor girl finally cracks.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts">PandoraHearts</a></em>, Jack is forced to kill his best friend Glen at the Tragedy of Sablier because Glen allegedly snapped and ordered the massacre of every man, woman, and child at the Baskervilles' mansion. In the biggest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a> of a series already known for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/HolyShitQuotient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/HolyShitQuotient">"Holy Shit!" Quotient</a>, however, it's later revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jack himself was the one who betrayed (Oswald) Glen's trust by opening the doors to the Abyss and attempting to bring the entire world down into it so that he could meet Lacie again. Ironically enough, just the night before Jack's betrayal, Glen asked his servant Gilbert whether or not he trusted Jack, and when the latter replied that he did, Glen decided to do the same.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PetShopOfHorrors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PetShopOfHorrors">Pet Shop of Horrors</a></em> demonstrates the second type of Et Tu Brute. Leon is convinced that Count D is a serial killer by proxy. Yet the two form a fairly intense friendship regardless, with Leon spending most, if not all, of his spare time with D. Despite the constant banter and Leon's empty threats of arrest, the detective is clearly fond of D, and while he can't disregard the Pet Shop's body count, he doesn't let it disrupt their personal relationship. What <em>does</em> cause the breakdown in their association seems relatively minor by comparison to murder, but the intensely personal nature of the betrayal makes the difference: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> D sends Leon's little brother Chris, who D and Leon have been looking after for the past year, back to his adoptive parents (actually his aunt and uncle) without telling Leon what's happening. Moreover, Leon is distressed by D's apparent lack of regret or sorrow over losing Chris.</span>
<ul><li> Arguably, it's D's reaction (or lack thereof), to the above event that constitutes a "betrayal" to Leon: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">for one, D doesn't send Chris back, Chris decides to go by his own free will, and two, since Chris is talking again, he couldn't stay in the petshop even if he wanted to. This is emphasized in the end of that chapter, and even earlier in the story.</span> What really gets to Leon is D being (acting?) completely indifferent over witnessing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Monica</span>'s death and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">distancing himself from Leon, treating him and, as Leon feels, Chris too, coldly and indifferently, as he did when they first met.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> A variation occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>. About 2/3 of the way through the first season, Lelouch learns that his best friend Suzaku is the person who's been constantly wrecking his plans. Rather than feeling betrayed, he simply redoubles his attempts to recruit Suzaku for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a>. At almost the exact same point in the second season, after lots of misunderstanding and misdirected rage, the two are close to patching up their friendship...when soldiers rush in and arrest Lelouch for being a terrorist. Lelouch <strong>thinks</strong> Suzaku betrayed him (he didn't, he was followed), but it pretty well marks the absolute death of their friendship and the moment Lelouch stops showing Suzaku any form of respect or mercy.
<ul><li> Then after being exposed to Lelouch's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">Broken Pedestal</a>, Suzaku quickly becomes a Knight <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">of Zero, to be specific, the Knight above Knight of Rounds</span> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> to the Emperor <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lelouch</span>. So... Did we mention that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it's all part of their plan to have him kill Lelouch after they take over the world so he can bring peace through his own death, and Suzaku <em>still</em> cried over killing him</span>?

</li><li> Yomi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaReiZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaReiZero">Ga-Rei -Zero-</a></em>. Short story: she killed a fellow exorcist who is also a fellow clan member, in defense and in a partially-justified rage. She expected her fiancee and her little sister to come to her defense, since she lost her capability of speaking after that battle. However, her fiancee never comes for her due to family honor. The final straw was her coming to a conclusion that even her little sister believes that she's guilty, and she went the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Griffith's</a> way.
<ul><li> It should be noted that said fiancee was working himself ragged(to the exclusion of his other, extremely important work) trying to prove her innocence so she wouldn't be cast out, and making preparations to take care of her in her disabled state, regardless of the outcome of his investigation. So even though she thinks he abandoned her... he's the one who was there for her the most. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Which only makes it more tragic.</a>

</li><li> This could also apply to L. In one episode of the anime, L tells Light that it'd be unfortunate if Light was Kira because he considers Light to be the only friend he's ever had.

</li><li> Robb Stark is betrayed by Theon Greyjoy in Season 2 when Theon seized Winterfell and this is reaction upon learning this. He is also betrayed by Rickard Karstark and later to his death by his bannerman Roose Bolton and Walder Frey in the Season 3 episode "The Rains of Castamere", although he's too numb to register it. Furthermore, he feels deeply betrayed by his mother Catelyn when she releases the Kingslayer (Jaime Lannister) behind his back.
</li><li> Shae is this to Tyrion in Season 4, which is implied to be revenge for sending her away. She returns as Cersei's star witness at Tyrion's trial and is notably the only person at his trial who tells an outright lie against him as well as twisting the knife further and citing their most heartwarming moments together and twisting them to humiliate Tyrion in the most gutwrenching possible way. This is the testimony which utterly breaks Tyrion and launches him far past the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a>, causing the poor man to just fucking lose it and explode with several decades worth of bitterness and rage at his ungrateful family and the ungrateful nobles of King's Landing.
</li><li> Missing the bigger picture, Tywin can hardly fathom that his children would be capable of rebelling against him. His miffed line, "You shot me," ("why, this is violence") carries far more indignation and disbelief than it does fear or pain, like that of which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar">Julius Caesar</a> expressed during his own assassination.
</li><li> Alton Lannister is killed by Jaime, his own older cousin, after telling him that he's his number one fan and that he would do anything to help him.

These include: Starbuck's infidelity between Lee and Samuel Anders(Lee also does the same to his wife during this), Gaeta's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a> and participation in a coup, Ellen Tigh's infidelity, Saul Tigh's murder of his wife, Baltar's desertion of his cult, and Cavil's actions towards <em>anyone</em> who disagrees with him.
</li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> had an abandoned Romulan prison camp full of Klingons, in which the two cultures merged and interbred. When Worf arrives and tries to teach the half-breed children about Klingon honor, the former Romulan prison commander sets up to execute him, and is standing there with his disruptor trained on Worf and all of the children go over and interpose themselves. He looks like he is about to pull the trigger anyway, but then his half-Klingon daughter (who has a crush on Worf) walks over to join them and utterly crushes his resolve.
</li><li> A better Star Trek example comes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space Nine</a></em> when a recurring character reveals himself to have been a mole for the terrorist/freedom-fighters the Maquis. Although the Maquis in general are depicted as a moral grey zone for the show (their cause is sympathetic but their methods illegal), Cpt. Sisko takes it VERY personally, to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">destroying a planet's biosphere to keep the Maquis from using it</a>. The former Mole even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> this trope in a later episode after the Maquis have been all but eliminated, pointing out to Sisko that it wasn't their agenda or even their methods that pissed off Sisko so much, it was the BETRAYAL by those Masquis who had once been Star Fleet officers, turning their backs on the Federation.
<ul><li> Also crosses the line into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Irony</a> territory when you consider that Eddington's entire reason for being there was because Starfleet was worried about the existing head of security not playing by their rules.
<div class="indent"><strong>Odo:</strong> Sir, have you ever reminded Starfleet Command that they stationed Eddington here because they didn't trust me? <br/><strong>Sisko:</strong> No. <br/><strong>Odo:</strong> Please do.
</div></li><li> Ironically, that same mole had previously betrayed Sisko by sabotaging the <em>Defiant</em> to stop Sisko from pursuing a ship...on orders from Starfleet.
</li><li> There's an even clearer example earlier on, where Sisko discovers an old friend and colleague to have switched sides. He's known the man for decades, and has always seen him as someone who shares his values. The only difference between the two is that his colleague has experienced the problems that led to the foundation of the Maquis first hand.
</li><li> Quark and Kira both react this way when, during the station's occupation by the Dominion, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Odo no-shows at a critical moment during a sabotage operation, causing the operation to fail and Rom to be arrested, because he's more concerned with the Link.

</li><li> In the episode "Inquisition," Dr. Bashir is hurt when even Sisko suspects him of suppressing memories of betraying the Federation.

In that episode, Discord, knowing about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a>, brainwashes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> into turning against each other. After a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircleOfShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircleOfShame">Circle of Shame</a> by the Discord's balloons, which tells her that her friends are laughing about her behind her back, corrupted Pinkie Pie's reply to Twilight Sparkle is to be expected when she and the corrupted Applejack found her:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Twilight Sparkle:</strong> Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you! <br/><strong>Pinkie Pie:</strong> Oh you are, huh? Why? Need a good laugh?
</div><ul><li> To say nothing about how poor Twilight felt when one by one, her friends are acting different from themselves, and when Rainbow Dash went flying out of the maze after what Applejack told her.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Applejack:</strong> (watching as Rainbow Dash went flying out of the maze) Well, looky there. Rainbow Dash is flying away. She's abandonin' us. <br/><strong>Twilight Sparkle:</strong> Now I know that's a lie. How can it be?
</div></li><li> A relatively mild example occurs in the episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E23PonyvilleConfidential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E23PonyvilleConfidential">"Ponyville Confidential"</a>. When the Gabby Gums column begins to print false-but-still-damaging stories of the mane six, it's initially suggested to Rarity that since Sweetie Belle works for the school paper, she might know who GG is. Rarity is immediately offended by the implication that her sister would associate with a pony with such blatant disregard for everyponys feelings. Her tune changes immediately once she discovers Sweetie Belle stole Rarity's diary and published it. To drive this home, Rarity confronts Sweetie with "Et tu, Gabby Gums?"

Yuan Shao asked Cao Cao to execute Zhang Miao for him, but Cao declined to do so. However, when Cao was invading the province of Xu in 194, Zhang Miao (fearing Cao would eventually do as Yuan asked) led a group of conspirators to invite the wandering warlord Lu Bu into Cao's territory and take over.
<ul><li> The kicker is that Cao Cao was invading Xu in order to avenge his father and brother, who'd just been murdered. While Zhang Miao himself escaped Cao Cao's wrath (by being murdered by his own men), Cao exterminated his family; the usual punishment for treason.
