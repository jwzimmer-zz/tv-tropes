</li><li> There's one amazingly funny <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR">NASCAR</a> themed commercial for Diet Mountain Dew out there. It starts with the #88 racecar being driven through a street. The driver does an amazing skid and comes to a stop in his driveway. The driver gets out:

</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> opens with the Black Swordsman Arc (volumes 1-3), introducing main character Guts as a vicious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalHero">Nominal Hero</a> on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> against the five evil deities called the God Hand, as well as their monstrous servants, the Apostles. At this point Guts is missing his right eye and left hand, and carries the cursed Brand of Sacrifice on his neck, which every night summons evil spirits to devour him. At the end of the Black Swordsman Arc we learn that the God Hand includes Guts' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchNemesis">Arch-Nemesis</a> Griffith, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends">used to be Guts' friend</a>. Then the Golden Age Arc (volumes 3 to 14) goes back in time and shows us the epic tragedy of how the brotherhood they forged on the battlefield was torn apart by Griffith's betrayal, with Griffith ascending to demonhood and Guts becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters">He Who Fights Monsters</a>. The anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Berserk1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Berserk1997">Berserk (1997)</a></em> follows the same progression by showing the Black Swordsman Arc in episode 1, and spending the rest of its 25 episodes on the Golden Age Arc.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO">The Big O</a></em>, episode 7, opens with Angel and Roger trapped in an old office building on the bottom of the ocean. In flashbacks, Roger shows how this came to pass.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em> manga has a variation. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the arc Enishi, has destroyed two buildings from people who have met Kenshin (one only once). He then meets Kenshin and challenges him to a duel, after Kenshin is forced to accept the challenge does Kenshin return and tell his friends why his brother-in-law wants revenge.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> almost did this, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>; the show's creators briefly considered beginning the series by showing Lelouch and Suzaku <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">pointing guns at each other, as per Episode 25</span> as the first scene, then going back several months to show how the two friends have gotten into such a situation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/OcculticNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/OcculticNine">Occultic;Nine</a></em>'s first episode starts with the discovery of hundreds of corpses found dead in a lake, with the story going back one week showing the events leading up to it.
</li><li> The anime version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em> does this with several of its' arcs, particularly Onikakushi-hen and Watanagashi-hen, which kick things off with the murder of one or more major characters and then hit the 'rewind' button back to the chronological start of the arc.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em> opens on the bridge of a vast space battleship as we see its mature and scarred commander, who holds in his hand a small conical key, launch an attack to open the final battle of an intergalactic war. Cut to teenage Simon, digging underground, discovering the key for the first time. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Subverted in that the war never happens, although we do get some idea of how it <em>might</em> have.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar">Outlaw Star</a></em> starts even before the OP with Gene taking off in the Outlaw Star and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">locks grapplers</span> with another ship. After said OP, the show begins that will lead up to this.
</li><li> The <em>entire series</em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiUniverse">Tenchi Universe</a> does this. The first episode opens with Tenchi delivering an internal monologue as he walks to school alone, lamenting the good old days when he used to hang out with those crazy girls from space... the show then spends nearly its entire run flashing back to how Tenchi met and went on adventures with said girls, until the last five minutes of the very last episode, when we return to Tenchi walking to school alone.
<ul><li> This is slightly screwed up in the dub. Tenchi's speech at the start of the series is the same one he gives at the very end, so we know we've come back to where we started. Two different translators handled those episodes, though, and each one translated the speech differently, so Tenchi ends up saying different things in each episode, even they're each supposed to portray the same moment in time.
</li></ul></li><li> Many modern episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> do this (especially in the original Japanese version) with the pre-credits teaser abruptly opening on a battle or other dramatic scene with no explanation as to how the characters got there. After the credits, we flash back to the start of the story.
<ul><li> This also lets the producers sneak in plenty of recycled footage, since the teaser sequence gets replayed once they arrive at that point in the story.
</li></ul></li><li> The second act of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> anime surprisingly starts with this. With Naruto and Sakura catching up to Sasuke for the first time since he defected from Konoha before starting the series proper and working it ways to that point. Likely as a tease to the fans.
</li><li> <em>Shigurui: Death Frenzy</em> starts at the very end and then goes to the beginning to show how it got there, but unfortunately it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding">never makes it back to the end again</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> has an in-universe version: The current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> sends the heroes a week forward in time, to when she's already won. Then various side characters explain to the heroes exactly how she won. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> So they go back in time to take advantage of the new information.</span>
<ul><li> The current arc of the manga counts, as it goes into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory">Back Story</a> and explains the events that directly led up to the beginning of the manga. Such as why Negi is being raised by his cousin in Wales, or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> how Asuna ended up at Mahora.</span>
</li><li> Natsumi says the trope almost word-by-word in her debut chapter, which opens with Kotarou holding her hostage.
</li></ul></li><li> The first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ShinMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ShinMazinger">Shin Mazinger</a></em> is titled "Finale" and depicts the seemingly climactic final battle between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Dr. Hell</a> and the protagonists. Episode 2 goes back to the beginning, and explains the build up from there.
</li><li> The second episode of the manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrawberryMarshmallow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrawberryMarshmallow">Strawberry Marshmallow</a></em> starts with Chika sitting in a wastebasket. Then we go back half an hour and find out what led up to this situation.
</li></ul><ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">prequel</a> movie <em>Legend of Kenshiro</em> begins with Kenshiro and Yuria going on their journey together after the defeat of Raoh. After having their wedding ceremony, Yuria asks Kenshiro to tell her of his quest to become the savior. The actual movie is set during the "lost year" after Kenshiro was first defeated by Shin, but before he met Bat and Lin.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ChaosHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ChaosHead">Chaos;Head</a></em> opens with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a destroyed city</span> and the protagonist laying in a puddle. He wakes but - but was it all really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">just a dream</a>?
</li><li> The first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em> starts at the end of its primary story (the 1931/Grand Punk Station arc) while the two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaGuy">Meta Guys</a> look over the records of the massacre and start arguing over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronicOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronicOrder">when the story is supposed to start</a>.

Some took the rest of the film as what happens once he's dead, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but it becomes obvious that it's this trope when it comes back to the same scene. He's clearly in some kind of hell, because it seems he can't die, and just gets hopelessly bloodied, bruised and generally knocked about by the train, without dying.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cloverfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cloverfield">Cloverfield</a></em> features a very subtle version.

When the diary is finished being read Daisy fills in the last part herself.
</li><li> The movie adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Daredevil">Daredevil</a></em> begins this way, with a mortally wounded Daredevil explaining in narration how he got to be in that position. Once his origin is told and the story catches up to that point, however, Daredevil inexplicably shrugs off his injuries (he literally gets up and walks it off).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DaveMadeAMaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DaveMadeAMaze">Dave Made a Maze</a></em>: The first scene of the film is an excerpt of Harry's interview with Dave for his documentary, which doesn't happen until the last twenty minutes of the movie.

His typewriter doesn't work, so he phones up the only other person in the building, and asks her to take down his story.

The film opens with a revolving shot of Deadpool hijacking a car in the middle of a bridge. The film proceeds to show how he got there, from riding a taxi to stopping in the bridge. As he wipes the floor with various goons, we flashback to much earlier in his life from before he got his cancer.

</li></ul></li><li> Beautifully subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDebt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDebt">The Debt</a></em>: near the beginning of the movie, a character (in 1997) reads a passage from a non-fiction book about an espionage mission she undertook in 1965. As she reads, we see the scene — the climax of the mission — unfold as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback">Flashback</a>. The events leading up to the climax take up most of the rest of the film, and the scene from the book eventually repeats itself. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Except that this time, when the Nazi prisoner knocks the heroine's head against the radiator, she's knocked out cold, and the bad guy gets away. Turns out that the three spies sent to capture him couldn't bear to report their failure and instead told the world that they'd killed him, knowing he'd go into hiding and no one but them would know he was alive.</span>

Arguably, this was to help explain the story to American audiences unfamiliar with the history, as in the play, there was no helpful narration either.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FightClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FightClub">Fight Club</a></em> starts with Tyler Durden holding a gun in the Narrator's mouth.

When the film catches up with itself (after the narrator states that "this is where we came in"), he asks the question again, and the Narrator replies he <em>still</em> can't think of anything, and Tyler quips, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">Flashback humor</a>."

</li><li> <em>For Love of the Game</em> has aging baseball pitcher Billy Chapel pitching the final game of his career, with most of the movie taken up by his reminiscences of the ups and downs of his career and the effects it's had on his relationship.

Barnum presenting his circus to an appreciative crowd in a rousing musical number. The music and the audience gradually fade as Barnum sings "It's everything you ever want/It's everything you ever need...." to where it seems he's talking to himself rather than the audience. Thus starts a flashback to Barnum as a boy admiring a frock coat and top hat in the tailor shop his father works at. When "The Greatest Show" is reprised, it's right where the flashback started. Barnum hands his partner his top hat and tells him to take over as ringmaster, saying that he's going to watch his girls grow up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHangover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHangover">The Hangover</a></em> has a double-dose of this. It starts with the main characters in the middle of the Nevada desert saying they're not going to make it to the wedding before flashing back two days. Then there's a variation when the crazy night happens, and in the aftermath leaves the <em>characters</em> asking how they got there.

</li><li> The season four finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em> featured scenes from far in the series' future, one of which showed a clip of Garibaldi being held hostage and apparently being shot. Almost the entire first half of season five was devoted to showing what happened to cause that scene.

</li><li> "Black Market" had one shoved in, thanks to Ron Moore thinking the episode didn't work at all, and needed to start with <em>something</em> to grab the audience's attention.

He glances behind him: a flash of what looks like two dead bodies sliding around on the floor. Beside him is an unconscious man, also in a gasmask. The episode then cuts to three weeks ago to show how we got there.
</li><li> Several other episodes begin with a bizarre scene shot in close-up so you can just get the barest idea of what's going on. Then the last scene shows you the whole thing. And of course, the king of them all is the burned, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathyDollShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathyDollShot">one-eyed teddy bear</a> in the pool, which takes the entire second season to explain.

We are shown how Fisk is passing his time as he plots the demise of a rival kingpin within the prison and (as later revealed in season 3) waits for his long-term manipulation of Ray Nadeem to pay off, buys the loyalty of a few inmates, and arranges for his messasge to passed on to Frank. This nine minute prologue ends with the last shot of the previous episode, and establishes that Fisk seeks to use Frank to get rid of Dutton.

When it catches up to the present, Fisk is snapped out of his musings by Arinori (one of the bribed agents on his payroll) barging in with a towel and telling him to get dressed so his lawyers can speak to him.

Most of the series is a flashback leading up to this point. At the end of the final episode, we see the first part of this scene again from a different camera angle.
</li><li> Several episodes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a> started out with an end-point prologue while the bulk of the episode explained how things got to this point.

They started to limit their use of it in Season 3, but in Season 4 they were back to using it almost every time just as they had been.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital">General Hospital</a></em>:
<ul><li> The show broke with the conventional soap opera conventions of storytelling during its February <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Sweeps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Sweeps">sweeps</a> 2007 hostage crisis storyline by showing the end result first (an explosion caused by a bomb) in the pre-opening credits teaser and then going back to where things had left off during the previous episode to show the events that set it in motion after the opening credits. In fact, the explosion depicted at the beginning of the episode did not happen for another 15 episodes after the first in which it was depicted. Each of those episodes opened with the explosion, albeit from a differing perspective.
</li><li> They then tried to create the same tension two years later with the much-maligned "Toxic Balls" storyline. This one took 10 episodes for the "flashback" to get to the beginning of that storyline. Each of those episodes opened with Patrick being interrogated by Agent Rayner, followed by Agent Winifred Leeds giving a report on people still in the hospital.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> This is the main framing device on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodGuys">The Good Guys</a></em>. An episode will begin with Dan and Jack in some very dangerous situation and then we jump back to how the case began and how the heroes got into that predicament. Throughout the episode you will get shorter flashbacks that explain why certain weird things happened and what some of the characters' reasons and motivations are. eg one flashback shows how a pimp decided to become a pimp because of something his father said twenty years before.
</li><li> The second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hannibal">Hannibal</a></em> opens with Jack walking into Hannibal's apartment and wordlessly drawing his gun, having somehow discovered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">the truth</a>. After Hannibal disarms Jack and they spend two minutes beating the hell out of each other, we jump back twelve weeks...to the two of them having dinner together.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HoratioHornblower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HoratioHornblower">Horatio Hornblower</a></em>: The second installment of this miniseries has two parts "Mutiny" and "Retribution". "Mutiny" starts with Commodore Sir Edward Pellew visiting Lieutenant Hornblower in prison, telling him and the audience that he's going to be tried for his life. The whole episode is told in one long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashBack">Flash Back</a>, though not entirely from Hornblower's point of view specifically. The episode ends in prison when Pellew and Hornblower finish their conversation. The next part, "Retribution", resumes the story where it was left, but this time it's more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes">In Medias Res</a> with telling scenes of badly injured Lieutenants Bush and Kennedy who are treated in the prison infirmary. The lieutenants face a trial and they continue to give a full account of what happened during the rest of their mission. It's being constantly interrupted with court testimonies and the judges' private discussion happening in the present. "Retribution" thus mixes In Medias Res with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronicOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronicOrder">Anachronic Order</a>.
</li><li> Due to its general <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashBack">flashbackyness</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em> does this a lot. In the first 2½ seasons there have been five <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere">How We Got Here</a> episodes. And it's also the premise of the entire show. It's right there in its title. However, when the first eight seasons of so were over, the audience knew next to nothing about said mother.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowToGetAwayWithMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowToGetAwayWithMurder">How to Get Away with Murder</a></em>: uses this constantly, flashing forwards to the aftermath of a brutal murder, then back to show how it eventually happened, with the events syncing up in the middle of the first season. Season two appears to be doing the same thing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em>, "Execution" begins with Stabler and Huang interrogating the prisoner. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeaser">The Teaser</a> ends as the prisoner attacks Huang. The bulk of the episode shows how and why they came to be interviewing the prisoner.
<ul><li> Another episode, based on the Natalee Holloway case, pairs this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes">In Medias Res</a>. It starts at the typical midpoint of the episode, with the suspects in question having been arrested and arraigned on murder charges. Although there are never any flashbacks, the dialogue serves to fill in the investigation that usually happens in the first half of the episode.
</li></ul></li><li> Several episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage">Leverage</a></em> begin with a snippet from a climactic moment from later in the episode and then jump back in time to show all of the events leading up to that moment. This most often takes the form of showing Nate in some kind of dangerous or apparently hopeless situation.
<ul><li> Season one's "The Second David Job" opens with Nate held at gunpoint by the mark and asking if he's going to kill him
</li><li> Season three's "The San Lorenzo Job" begins with Nate being dragged before a corrupt European dictator and the season's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and admitting that "we didn't have a chance in hell."
</li><li> "The First David Job" opens with Nate pulling a gun on the mark and apparently in the midst of a breakdown, which turns out to happen very early on as part of the con. In the opening of "The Grave Danger Job," it's Hardison who's in trouble and the scene happens about halfway through the episode, after which point the rest of the episode follows the team's efforts to rescue him.
</li><li> The series finale is an interesting example. It appears to be a straight version mixed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhAndXDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhAndXDies">most of the cast dying</a>. However it actually turns out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRashomon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRashomon">The Rashomon</a> in which Nate was lying so that they could manipulate Interpol into allowing them access to hidden files.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The pilot episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Limitless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Limitless">Limitless</a></em> begins with Brian already fleeing his friend's murder scene while being chased by FBI agents, and follows his pursuit into the subway. It stops just before the train (almost) hits him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode "The Brig" differs from the usual flashback structure by having the episode begin with Locke speaking to an unseen prisoner in the brig, then showing the events leading to that moment instead of pre-crash, off-island flashbacks. Another episode in which flashbacks are used this way is "Exposé".
</li><li> "Catch-22" opens with one of Desmond's prophetic visions (in this case, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Charlie getting shot in the throat with an arrow</span>), and most of the episode leads up to this.
</li><li> The episode "316" is a more traditional example, with a cold opening followed by a single episode-long flashback (as opposed to several flashback intercut with the main plot as traditionally used) revealing the events leading up to it. That makes one of the only three episodes of the show not to feature a secondary storyline.
</li><li> There are arguably elements of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere">How We Got Here</a> to the series as a whole, what with its non-linear time structure. Aside from the general format of showing why the characters boarded the doomed plane, other episodes have revealed the origin stories of other characters who found their way to the island. "Live Together, Die Alone" introduces Desmond's backstory and the sailing race that led to his marooning on the island. "The Man Behind the Curtain" shows how Ben Linus, leader of the Others, came to the island as a child with the DHARMA Initiative. "Some Like it Hoth" and "The Variable" reveal why Miles and Daniel, respectively, boarded the freighter bound for the island. Finally, "Ab Aeterno" reveals the powerful backstory of Richard Alpert, the immortal advisor of the Others and his arrival to the island <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">on the Black Rock slave ship</span>.
</li><li> "The Other 48 Days" shows us how the tailies got where they are and "Not in Portland" and "One of Us" as a set show how Juliet came to be on the island.
</li></ul></li><li> Many of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Maverick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Maverick">Maverick</a></em> episodes start with a teaser of a dramatic moment that will occur ~30 minutes in.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurdochMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurdochMysteries">Murdoch Mysteries</a></em>:
<ul><li> "Anything You Can Do..." opens with Murdoch, his father and a Mountie in an abandoned building being shot at by several people (the exact number is the subject of some debate among the characters). Then the action shifts to some days earlier when Murdoch is called to a suspicious death on his home turf and meets the Mountie, Sgt. Jasper Linney. From there, the story goes back and forth between events in Toronto and the situation in that abandoned town, which proves to be in Linney's jurisdiction.
</li><li> "The Murdoch Trap" opens with Murdoch lying unconscious on the floor of what proves to be a cage. After he comes to, he finds <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a hanging mannequin that looks like Julia with a recording of her voice playing </span> and is greeted by his captor <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> James Gillies</span>. The story goes back to events a week earlier and then alternates between that backstory and Murdoch's present predicament.
</li></ul></li><li> At least one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">MythBusters</a></em> shows the group as they're about to launch into the final, full-scale experiment, then has one of them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">say they can't start at the end</a>. Most of the rest of the episode then shows how they got to that stage, with the payoff at the very end.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode "Cloak" uses How We Got Here to fit the usual progression of the agents starting the episode at a crime scene, investigating. The action reaches a cliffhanger and freezes. Flashbacks then explain how it all came to be before wrapping back around to where the opening left two of Our Heroes in danger.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdOpen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdOpen">Cold Open</a> for the episode "Requiem" had Tony DiNozzo in a suit, running full-tilt through a warehouse, taking out two gunmen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">without missing a beat</a> and diving over a pier to rescue Gibbs and a civilian after the car they were in was forced off the pier. The rest of the episode reveals who the civilian was and how Gibbs got involved.
</li></ul></li><li> The episode "Revenge" for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NedsDeclassifiedSchoolSurvivalGuide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NedsDeclassifiedSchoolSurvivalGuide">Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide</a></em> starts with Cookie being chased by Evelyn, a mystery girl being pelted with volleyballs, and Ned hanging upside-down. The rest of the episode shows how that all happened.
</li><li> The pilot for<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNewNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNewNormal">The New Normal</a></em> shows how the household came together.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceAndAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceAndAgain">Once and Again</a></em>'s season one finale "A Door, About To Open" begins with Lily and Rick's families finally about to meet, and then flashes back to the day before.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneHundredDeedsForEddieMcdowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneHundredDeedsForEddieMcdowd">100 Deeds for Eddie McDowd</a></em> pilot episode has Eddie, after being taken to a dog pound, retracing his steps off how he became a dog.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOtherTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOtherTwo">The Other Two</a></em>: An episode opens with Brooke and Carey in Times Square discussing Chase's VMA performance and how their lives are now ruined, before flashing back to the events that lead up to the scene.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Poirot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Poirot">Poirot</a></em> adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SadCypress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SadCypress">Sad Cypress</a></em> begins with Elinor Carlisle standing in the dock about to hear the verdict of her murder trial, bitterly reflecting in voice-over on how quickly her life completely fell apart. We then go back to a point just before her life completely fell apart to see exactly what happened.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM">Power Rangers RPM</a></em> did this several times. The series starts with the city of Corinth being sealed off against attack, and Scott, Summer, and Flynn zooming in at the last minute. The series skips to a year later, when they're already established as Rangers, and introduces Dr K, Dillon, and Ziggy. Each of them (except for Dillon, but he has amnesia) has an episode titled after them, which shows a normal episode interspaced with flashbacks showing what kind of people they are, and how they got into Corinth, leading directly into the first episode again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePretender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePretender">The Pretender</a></em> did this in the second and third episodes involving Argyle. Both episodes start with Jarod and Argyle in some predicament, then go back and show how they wound up there.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyLittleLiars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyLittleLiars">Pretty Little Liars</a></em> uses this trope quite frequently, at least once per most seasons:
<ul><li> "The Lady Killer" opens with Hanna distraught in the aftermath of a crime scene <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (Caleb was shot during Nate's attack on Emily - unlike Nate, he survives)</span>.
</li><li> "Unbridled" begins with Spencer in a forest at night in a wedding dress, pulled up short after a sharp sound <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which is the veil caught in a bear trap (she and the other Liars are modelling wedding dresses at an event and Spencer took off to follow someone. That someone may have put human bones in her girdle...)</span>.
</li><li> "Taking This One To The Grave" begins at another crime scene, this one on Thanksgiving Day, with all the Liars except Spencer present. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Spencer was arrested the previous day for murdering Bethany Young; Mona told the others she could prove Alison was A... and was then brutally murdered. In her own home.</span>
</li><li> "Over My Dead Body" begins with the girls, wearing party dresses and covered in dirt (later a common motif in many of their promo photos) sitting in an interrogation room as the police discuss the fact that they're murderers. It skips to 48 hours beforehand. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Each girl was forced by A to do something to ruin their own lives because A was holding their therapist hostage. When the girls complete their tasks A gives them coordinates to where they have allegedly buried her alive, only for them to start digging and realize that they have just been framed to look like they are burying a murder weapon in the woods.</span>
</li><li> "Tick, Tock, Bitches" begins with Aria, Emily, and Spencer tearfully burying someone, crying that if they didn't, they would be committed for murder and that this is what Hanna would want. The episode skips back four days, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to reveal that the person they are burying is Dr. Rollins. Hanna hit him with her car, and she is sitting in a state of shock while the other girls dig.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych">Psych</a></em> did this with the episode with Uncle Jack where most of the episode is Shawn, Henry, and Gus explaining how they were led on a treasure hunt by Jack Spencer. Most of the telling takes place in the interrogation room after the three of them are arrested.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "Thanks for the Memory", the characters wake up four days after the opening scene with no memories of these days, a half-finished jigsaw completed and two of the characters with broken legs.
</li><li> Several times in "Backwards", on the planet where time runs in reverse. For example, Lister lands on the planet with a black eye and bruised ribs, and doesn't know why until the bar-room brawl (or tidy) breaks out (during which his injuries get healed).
</li><li> "Back In The Red" opens with Lister in prison with a living Rimmer, and apart from that and one other scene, the entire three-part storyline is dedicated to how they got there.
</li></ul></li><li> The first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ReGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ReGenesis">ReGenesis</a></em> begins with David rushing to the lab in a panic when he's hit by a car. The rest of the episode flashes back to a seemingly unrelated story, and the season continues from there. It isn't until the second-to-last episode of the season that the story catches up to the first scene, by which point we've found out the events of the first episode and the flashforward aren't so unrelated after all.
</li><li> Used as the opening to each successive season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Revenge">Revenge</a></em>, the reveal typically taking place mid-season.
<ul><li> The first starts with a man, presumably Daniel, being shot on the beach the night of Emily and his engagement party.
</li><li> The second starts with a salvage team discovering the sunken remains of the boat "The Amanda" along with a dead body.
</li><li> The third starts with Emily in a wedding dress being shot by an unknown assailant and falling off a yacht.
</li><li> Done for the episodes "Duress" and "Sabotage".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ringer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ringer">Ringer</a></em>'s 19th episode starts out with the apparent death of the main character and then captions "Two days earlier..."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RiseOfEmpiresOttoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RiseOfEmpiresOttoman">Rise of Empires: Ottoman</a></em>: The series opens during the middle of the siege of Constantinople, when one of the Ottoman cannons explodes as a result of overuse with Mehmet knocked to the ground by the force. It then flashes back to his upbringing and the build-up to the siege.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scorpion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scorpion">Scorpion</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode "True Colors" starts with the team in evening wear (except Sylvester) standing next to a burning sports car while a government agent berates them, then shows how they got to that point.
</li><li> The third season episode "It's Not The Fall That Kills You" opens with Walter falling through the air, plummeting to almost-certain death, then cuts to six hours earlier to show how he wound up there.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em> "backwards" episode showed the scenes of the story in reverse order, à la <em>Memento</em>, with on-screen notations "three hours earlier", "20 minutes earlier", etc. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> with:
<div class="indent"><strong>Jerry:</strong> Bless you. <br/><em>0.4 seconds earlier</em> <br/><strong>Jerry's date:</strong> Achoo!
</div></li><li> The pilot episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ServantOfThePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ServantOfThePeople">Servant of the People</a></em> starts with a history teacher learning he has been elected to be president of the country. While the episode itself follows him around on his first day, it is peppered with flashbacks that explain how such a situation came to be.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a>, <em>Crisis</em>, Lana is apparently fatally shot at the beginning of the episode. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks">Kryptonite</a> enabled a <em>time travelling phone call</em>. The whole thing becomes a time loop of sorts as the Kents and Chloe try to change the future, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">with little success</a>. Except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superman">Clark</a> could, due him having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessIsAForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessIsAForce">Awesomeness Is a Force</a>. It is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">shown</a> in <em>Hereafter</em>, an episode in the previous season, that Clark is able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Screw Destiny</a>.</span>
</li><li> Done several times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>, most notably in "Meridian", which begins with Daniel returning to the SGC with a lethal dose of radiation, and one of the two subplots in this episode is spent on the mystery behind it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>, "The Menagerie". However, this example is more a case of incorporating an older piece of footage into an episode. It does not begin in the "middle of the story" and then flash back.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>:
<ul><li> The show plays with the trope with the Season 5 episode "Cause and Effect". The very first thing we see of the episode is the <em>Enterprise</em> collide with a suddenly-appearing starship <em>and blowing up</em>. After the title screen, we see the Enterprise intact and learn this is <em>seemingly</em> the trope...until the ship explodes <em>again</em> shortly afterward. It's only then that you realize the episode is not really How We Got Here but a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a>.
</li><li> The Season 6 episode "Suspicions" plays the trope straight. Guinan visits Dr. Crusher in her quarters for an elbow problem, but Crusher reveals she's about to be drummed out of her position. Most of the episode goes into the story behind it, then when it finally catches up we see Crusher find a way to solve the episode's problem (which would've led to her disgrace).
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> episode "Whispers" opens with O'Brien alone in a runabout, making a log entry about being on the run from "them". He goes on to explain how he first became aware of "them" and how that eventually led to him fleeing the station.
<ul><li> Similarly, "In The Pale Moonlight" begins with Sisko making a log entry describing the events of the preceeding few days, which is then cut back to periodically as said events are depicted.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>'s "Thirty Days" begins with Tom Paris being demoted to Ensign and sentenced to the title length in the brig for disobeying direct orders; he narrates the events that led to his temporary disgrace<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0xuil');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0xuil" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0xuil');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> he gets restored to his former rank the following season, in "Unimatrix Zero, Part 1"</span> in the form of a log to his father.
</li><li> The first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Stumptown2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Stumptown2019">Stumptown</a></em> opens with two guys driving Dex's car, with Dex in the trunk, while "Sweet Caroline" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilDiamond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilDiamond">Neil Diamond</a> plays on the stereo, then jumps back two days to show how they got there.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em>, on occasion. We get one of the brothers doing something ridiculously out of character, and then 'Two Days Earlier' with a reasonably logical explanation for that (normally 'it was a shapeshifter, not Dean/Sam at all').
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Thunderbirds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Thunderbirds">Thunderbirds</a></em>: "Move And You're Dead" starts with Alan and Grandma stranded on a bridge, with a bomb that will explode if they move. While Thunderbirds 1 and 2 are on their way to save them, Alan tells Jeff about how they ended up there.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone1959" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone1959">The Twilight Zone (1959)</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode "To Serve Man" begins with the doomed protagonist telling the viewer how he came to be trapped on an alien ship and forced to eat.
</li><li> The episode "The Howling Man" starts with elderly David Ellington explaining that his "is a fantastic story". Fade to forty years earlier and a young Ellington arriving at a monastery run by a very interesting group of religious men...
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheTwilightZoneS5E156TheBewitchinPool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheTwilightZoneS5E156TheBewitchinPool">The Bewitchin' Pool</a>" opens with Gil and Gloria Sharewood telling their children Sport and Jeb that they plan to divorce, which is a scene from towards the end of the episode. This was because the production was short of usable footage.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheThundermans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheThundermans">The Thundermans</a></em> episode "A Hero is Born" starts with Max trying to save Dr Colosso with his telekinesis, but fails. The voice over, in Dr Colosso's voice, then transitions the episode to when it all began. The scene that started the episode comes at the very end.
</li><li> Kids sitcom <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Unfabulous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Unfabulous">Unfabulous</a></em> uses this very often. Typically the show begins with the central character in trouble, in plaster, or covered in food, water, or other liquids. She then explains (in voiceover) that to understand how she got into this mess, we'll have to go back a few days.
</li><li> Several episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnnaturalHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnnaturalHistory">Unnatural History</a></em> begins with the characters facing imminent danger at an unknown location, then goes back showing how they got into the situation.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/V2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/V2009">V (2009)</a></em> begins with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">Fifth Column</a> heroes shooting down a V transport that was carrying humans, then flashes back to "14 hours before" and the events that led to that tragedy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars">Veronica Mars</a></em>:
<ul><li> The pilot begins this way on the DVD version, with Veronica being confronted by Weevil's biker gang before rolling back 20 hours. On the original UPN version, it begins at her school, 20 hours before the confrontation with Weevil.
</li><li> The episode "The Girl Next Door" (with a pre-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZeroDarkThirty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZeroDarkThirty">Zero Dark Thirty</a></em> Jessica Chastain in the title role) tells its tale in flashback in both versions. Played with: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's made pretty clear that said 'girl next door' is the dead body Veronica wonders if she could have saved if things had gone differently... but the corpse was never actually shown. The girl is fine, it was her would-be killer who died.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Waco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Waco">Waco</a></em> opens with the ATF about to raid Mount Carmel, before jumping back nine months to show the lead-up to the shootout.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WalkingWithDinosaurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WalkingWithDinosaurs">Walking with Dinosaurs</a></em>:
<ul><li> The fourth episode begins by showing the dead body of the episode's protagonist, a male <em>Ornithocheirus</em>. The rest of the episode focus on this very last flight and, with it, the circumstances that lead to his death.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em> played with this trope several times. Many episodes include flashbacks, which answer major questions relating to character motivation and history, but only a few use this trope to present the <em>main</em> plot's end at the start of the episode or to start the series of events bringing the viewer to the end.
<ul><li> The first season finale plays the trope straight, leading to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceMoreWithClarity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceMoreWithClarity">Once More, with Clarity!</a> in the final moments.
</li><li> <em>Noel</em> is another straight example: the episode begins on December 24th with Josh being asked how he injured his hand but the story presented occurs over the previous weeks.
</li><li> When Hoynes resigns, we see an assistant carrying a letter into the Oval Office, the President talking to her, and everybody being very solemn about it, culminating in Bartlet opening the letter and the audience seeing that it is Hoynes's letter of resignation, effective 6AM that day. We then jump to 24 hours earlier after the opening credits, to see what led up to a very Wham-type of development.
</li><li> The final season opens three years in the future with several characters meeting at the dedication of the Bartlet Presidential Library, with the new president shown as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoMustNotBeSeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoMustNotBeSeen">He Who Must Not Be Seen</a>. The rest of the season shows how they got there and who won the Presidential election.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Wings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Wings">Wings</a></em>:
<ul><li> The opening and ending of "Joe Blows" are similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SunsetBoulevard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SunsetBoulevard">Sunset Boulevard</a></em>.
</li><li> "As Fate Would Have It" begins with the plane about to crash. The bulk of the episode explains the circumstances that put the characters in that situation.
</li></ul></li><li> The first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WolfHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WolfHall">Wolf Hall</a></em> begins with Thomas Cromwell helping Cardinal Wolsey prepare for his exile to the north. It then jumps back to several years beforehand when Cromwell first enters his service, not long before Henry VIII demands Wolsey get his marriage to Catherine of Aragon annulled. When the episode catches up, Cromwell goes to Henry's court in an ultimately vain effort to get Wolsey recalled from his disgrace.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Wonderfalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Wonderfalls">Wonderfalls</a></em>: The episode <em>Crime Dog</em> starts with Jaye in jail being questioned by the police, then moves backwards to explain "how exactly that woman wound up in the trunk of (her) car." Notably, they often cut back to Jaye and her family as they are explaining the story to clarify things... and also just for comedic value.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em>:
<ul><li> Episode "Monday" opens with Skinner arriving at a bank that Mulder and Scully are inside, shortly before the bank blows up. All this happens in the teaser. After the credits and commercial break, we're in the hallway outside Mulder's apartment a few hours before the explosion as his day begins badly (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">we revisit this spot several times</a>).
</li><li> "Bad Blood" starts with a man pursuing a teenager and killing him with a stake. The man is revealed to be Mulder. After the teaser, Mulder and Scully meet at the office.

Notable in that the game has a branching storyline, but the outcome is set: No matter which god you serve, the world's going to end up a wreck. Similar to <em>Prince of Persia</em> above, the narrator comments "Now where was I... ah yes." when loading or "Of course, that's not what really happened." when restarting.

You find the skeletons of your ancestors in the basement of your building together with some movie reels that contain the story of what happened to them.

Periodically throughout the game, you suffer flashbacks to an adventure you had in Russia, where you were acting as a paranormal specialist (with a strong disbelief in psychic powers). The twist is that flashbacks are usually triggered by discovering something that triggers your memory, but (really quite minor spoiler) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after what happens in the flashback doesn't match the information you received, (i.e. some one you knew supposedly dying in Russia), the information changes to reflect your memory (same example- the person's records listing them as alive, now)</span>.

You start out with handcuffs on one of your arms, the player running from the police, and then jumping onto a subway train.

The game then flashes back and forth between that point and four months prior when everything started, and eventually sticks you back four months ago and goes from there. You get back to the hanging train car about halfway through the game. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And then you have to climb it <em>again</em>, with Nate complaining about all the spoilery stuff you wouldn't have known about at first, such as Chloe refusing to be rescued from Lazarevic and how his "hero" efforts aren't appreciated and how he is just <em>sick</em> of climbing shit...</span>

The gameplay starts out controlling Nathan steering the boat and shooting at the enemy until crashing on shore. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Unlike Uncharted 2, you don't have to do the same thing again once you get to this point of the game which skips to getting marooned with Nate and Sam getting separated.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ElementalGearbolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ElementalGearbolt">Elemental Gearbolt</a></em>, as evidenced by its <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AX-W7ZpipDg">introductory cutscene<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, the legend of Hawke is told by Varric, a dwarven companion of his/hers to the Chantry Seeker Cassandra. Varric for his part plays a bit of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>, exaggerating certain parts of the story whenever he feels like it while Cassandra tries to find the true story.

</li><li> The campaign of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostRecon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostRecon">Ghost Recon</a>: Shadow Wars</em> starts off with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedTutorial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedTutorial">Forced Tutorial</a> of two soldiers in a mission with no explanation of why they were there in the first place except a few dialogue. After which the actual campaign starts in the beginning. Four-fifth through the game, the tutorial mission got to be replayed again as an actual mission near the end of the story.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3ODST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3ODST">Halo 3: ODST</a></em> is practically built around this trope. You begin the game several hours after the battle has been lost, having been knocked unconscious during the opening cutscene. Much of the game is spent searching for clues as to what happened that day, whereupon you play flashback levels <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowForSomeoneCompletelyDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowForSomeoneCompletelyDifferent">from the perspective of one of your team-mates</a>.

The shot quickly transitions to their POV of holding the same, undamaged helmet, and them putting it on as they arrive on Reach a month earlier. The rest of the game shows the fall of Reach to the Covenant from Six's perspective, ending in their death and on the same shot as the opening.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOps">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a></em> uses this as its framing device, with Mason in the midst of an interrogation for 95% of the game and the actual missions being him recounting his experiences to the other men in the room.
</li><li> <em>Call of Duty: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Modern Warfare</a> 3</em> has a level where you start out in the middle of an ambush. The mission then flashes back 20 minutes to show you how you ended up in that ambush. Sadly, it feels like they really shouldn't have bothered with the flashback.

When the player finally reaches that point, Rucks runs out of story to tell, and instead starts talking about their present situation and speculating what's going on on The Kid's end.

Although, unlike the other examples on this page, this was a premonition of events by one of the main characters <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and presumably a future memory about how things went wrong in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a></span>.

Each flashback shows a little bit of what the group was up to at a bar in Bangkok, which was supposed to be their last stop on their vacation, before the DJ that Jason befriended told them about a little-known island where they could do anything they wanted...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em>, the FES epilogue The Answer begins with an unexplained but fierce battle between Akihiko and Aigis, while Metis and Ken are seen fighting in the background.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FinalSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FinalSpace">Final Space</a></em> begins with Gary drifting alone in space with having only ten minutes of oxygen left to live with HUE as his only companion. It then goes back showing the events leading to Gary's predicament.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones">The Flintstones</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode "The Tycoon" begins with Fred getting yelled at by Wilma and the Rubbles at home. A narrator flashes back to when J.L. Gotrocks, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalStranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalStranger">a dead-ringer for Fred</a>, escaped his monotonous tycoon job and convinced Fred to be his replacement. While out, he encounters the three and acts like a huge jerk toward them; after the two doppelgängers switch back, Fred comes home to a bitter reception and doesn't understand why. Poor Fred.
</li><li> The episode "The Golf Champion" opens with Fred winning the Loyal Order of Dinosaurs' gold championship, only for Barney to rush the field and try to wrestle the trophy out of his hands. A reporter on the scene asks a spectator what prompted the fight, and the ensuing flashback tells of when Barney got elected to be club's president and vowed to make sure all its members pay their back dues; Fred hadn't paid his, and Barney wants to withhold the trophy until he does.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>'s <em>Star Trek</em>-themed episode, "Where No Fan Has Gone Before", parodying the TOS episode listed above.
<ul><li> Also happens twice with the first episode of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCancelled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCancelled">2010 season</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> did this in "Revelations". The first scene is of Goliath being tortured by Mace Malone, as Matt Bluestone (who, in previous episodes, didn't even know the Gargoyles definitely existed) watches. We then get the explanation of how this happened from Bluestone.
</li><li> The premiere episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em>, "Tourist Trapped", starts out like this, with Dipper explaining to the audience why he and his sister are trying to outpace a giant in a golf cart.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy">The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy</a></em>, in the episode "Billy and Mandy Begins". Irwin's question about how they got to be dangling over a giant serpent monster is misinterpreted as a question of how Grim ended up with Billy and Mandy. Two distorted accounts and an accurate synopsis of the pilot take up nearly the entire episode, and by the time it's clarified that the question was how they got in <em>that specific situation</em>, everyone's eaten alive before it can be answered.
</li><li> Brendon Small of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HomeMovies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HomeMovies">Home Movies</a></em> tried to do this with one of his films, but did it badly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem">Jem</a></em>: The pilot starts with an already famous Jem being well-received by her fans and then it flashbacks to the graveyard scene with Jem's father being buried.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>; Season 4 opens by catching up with everyone after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> save Korra herself, who's shown at the end <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightClubbing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightClubbing">Fight Clubbing</a> in an Earth Kingdom slum while bitterly denying her identity as the Avatar. The next episode covers her attempt to recover from her injuries and PTSD received in Season 3 before she ran away and ended up where she was in the premier.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse">The Loud House</a></em>: "Friendzy" starts with the Loud Siblings fighting each other, and the police showing up to break up the fight. Lincoln then proceeds to tell the audience how things got out of hand so much.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegasXLR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegasXLR">Megas XLR</a></em> did this rather breezily, when they fought a giant cheese monster. Coop put aerosol spray cheese into the reactor on a dare.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em> started with a half-naked Doofenshmirtz, Perry the Platypus serving as his butler, Carl in a cage dressed like a squirrel, Linda showing up to return Perry's fedora hat to Carl, and a band showing up. Rather than simply flashing back to the beginning, the episode kept flashing back to key moments of the story and then returned to present time.
</li><li> The opening scene of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyAndTheBrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyAndTheBrain">Pinky and the Brain</a></em> episode "Brain Noir" spoofs <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SunsetBoulevard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SunsetBoulevard">Sunset Boulevard</a></em>, with Brain narrating how he came to be floating face down in a pool of water.
</li><li> The <em>Mickey MouseWorks</em> short "Topsy Turvy Town" (which was one of the <em>MouseWorks</em> shorts repackaged as part of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HouseOfMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HouseOfMouse">House of Mouse</a></em> episode "Daisy's Debut") begins with Mickey and Minnie in a cell while a cloaked figure informs them that it is time for their punishment. The short then reveals how Mickey and Minnie got into this situation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em>: An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> in "Look Who's Purging Now", while Rick is setting up a signal beacon, Morty is asked to listen to The Lighthouse Chief's hackneyed screenplay, which begins with a dramatic moment and then flashes back to three week earlier. After hearing the whole screenplay, Morty gives his honest review that he suggests to just start the screenplay when the story starts. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> once the Lighthouse demands they leave for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantTakeCriticism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantTakeCriticism">insulting his work.</a>
</li><li> The first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RubyGloom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RubyGloom">Ruby Gloom</a></em> starts with Ruby running through the house, seemingly avoiding her friends as they try to get her attention. Then, it takes us back (with a narrator reading as the words are typed on the screen) to "EARLIER THAT DOY" (the last word being a miswritten "day").
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> has done this a few times, with one of the better examples being "The Telltale Head", which begins with Bart and Homer, carrying the head of Jebediah Springfield, being chased by a lynch mob, with pretty much the rest of the episode consisting of Bart telling the mob the tale of the events that led up to him decapitating a statue of Jebediah Springfield (and the subsequent encounter with the mob).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan">The Spectacular Spider Man</a></em>
<ul><li> The episode "Catalysts" opens in the middle of a battle between Spider-Man and Green Goblin in a crowded ballroom, while the rest of the episode details how they got to that point.
</li><li> Also in the episode "Subtext", though this goes back and forth between flashbacks and actual events.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Spliced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Spliced">Spliced</a></em> had "Octocataclysm", which was an explanation of why Smarty Smarts was chasing Octocat with a laser and furiously meowing.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants">Spongebob Squarepants</a></em> episode <em>Missing Identity</em> has Spongebob tell the story of how he found his missing identity.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em> episode "Cheer Up, Star" opens with Marco and Star being assaulted by a small army of Ludo's minions, and eventually flashes back to how Marco got them into this mess.
</li><li> The first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StretchArmstrongAndTheFlexFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StretchArmstrongAndTheFlexFighters">Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters</a></em>, "Confessions of a Teenage Superhero", introduces the Flex Fighters during a battle with Multi-Farious, then shows how they got their powers by backtracking to the day Jake and Nathan met Ricardo.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StrokerAndHoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StrokerAndHoop">Stroker and Hoop</a></em> parodies this in an episode. The first shot is Stroker lying on the sidewalk, bleeding out. He proceeds to tell an episode-long story of how he got there (involving ninja) and when the entire thing concludes, it turns out that he ended up on the sidewalk by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">slipping on his son's skateboard</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries">Superman: The Animated Series</a></em>: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SupermanTheAnimatedSeriesS2E22TheLateMrKent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SupermanTheAnimatedSeriesS2E22TheLateMrKent">The Late Mr. Kent</a>" starts with Clark's funeral and then it goes back to the beginning of the events that led <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Detective Bowman</span> to want him dead.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SushiPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SushiPack">Sushi Pack</a></em> uses this trope to set up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRashomon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRashomon">Rashomon</a>, with two characters remembering the events of the day differently as they try to figure out how they ended up on an asteroid hurtling toward Earth.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TangledTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TangledTheSeries">Tangled: The Series</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode "Not in the Mood" begins with King Frederic ordering Rapunzel to be locked up. Cue the "24 Hours Earlier..." card.
</li><li> The episode "Who's Afraid of the Big, Bad Wolf" begins with Rapunzel being chased by a werewolf. Cue the "34 Hours Earlier..." card.
</li></ul></li><li> The 2003 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em> often used this device as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeaser">The Teaser</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Underdog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Underdog">Underdog</a></em> episode "Underdog Vs. Overcat" has this format.
