Because Domyouji made her life Hell as a child, she pulls off quite the revenge plot that includes plastic surgery, seducing him, almost killing his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl">Plucky Girl</a> of a love interest, etc. Sheeesh.

She confesses to Lelouch with a deep and passionate kiss. He responds... well, not at all. And then he kidnaps all the world's leaders.</span> She resolves to kill him with her own hands. For Love And Justice.
</li><li> Sara Yuki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Dancougar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Dancougar">Dancougar</a></em>, actually a heroic example of this, because the one who dumps her happens to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a> working for the bad guys.
</li><li> In the Mello/Near arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>, Light's college sweetheart and Kira supporter, Takada, threatens to kill him if he doesn't get rid of Misa, his longtime "girlfriend" of the series.
<ul><li> Earlier, Misa had threatened to kill any girl that she saw Light with.

<ul><li> In a strange (and funny) twist, Ran also got very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">tsuntsun</a> when a girl named Youko Akagi showed up in the doorstep of the office, falsely claiming to be Shinichi's girlfriend (the little boy she was babysitting had been kidnapped and Ryouko needed Shinichi's <em>help</em>, using the "girlfriend" claim as her cover).
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nami Kasakura</span> from the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Blooming Sakura"</span> case might be the biggest example, thanks to her <em>really</em> bitter and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">loud</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveRant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveRant">Motive Rant</a> in which she explains how badly her boyfriend fucked her over and how she decided to kill him in revenge.

</li><li> When Gayle hunted down Motoko in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em>, he managed to shoot away her left arm and nearly succeeded in killing her. She was saved at the last moment when Saito and Paz showed up with a .50 caliber anti-material tank rifle loaded with high-velocity ammo. Two shots were all it took to knock Gayle over and free her. As soon as she stood up, she ordered Saito to hand over the weapon right away, where she climbed up on top of Gayle and pointed the gun right at the cockpit armor plating. At that point, Motoko went into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a> shown beautifully through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">Tranquil Fury</a>. Gayle was already quaking in fear, asking her to open the hatch so he could properly surrender. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeLongRangeWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeLongRangeWeapon">Motoko unloaded a full clip at point blank right into the cockpit armor plating</a></em>, not stopping until she had no ammo left. At that point, the armor had been dented so far in that the pressure was suffocating Gayle inside. He was begging for her to open the cockpit, because he couldn't breathe. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelMercy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelMercy">She allowed him to live so that he would forever REGRET hunting her down.</a>
<ul><li> A very straight example of this is the third OVA of ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellArise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellArise">Ghost in the Shell: Arise</a>" where Motoko dated a doctor who retrofitted her cybernetic legs. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Except that the doctor is a terrorist and is aware of Motoko's occupation and the legs that he retrofitted contained explosives</span>. Motoko eventually learned about this and proceeded to find him so she can put a bullet on his head.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GregoryHorrorShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GregoryHorrorShow">Gregory Horror Show</a></em>, it's implied that the second season's Guest is this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Judgement Boy Gold brings up the fact that her former boyfriend, after she turned down his marriage proposal, got engaged to one of her best friends. Unlike the previous scenario the Judgement Boys bring up, he doesn't actually say what she did after that, but says that "her heart must have been very heavy indeed", implying that she killed him.</span>

This is chillingly summed up as: "She was making a subconscious threat — <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfICantHaveYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfICantHaveYou">if you don't love me, I'll kill you</a></em>."
</li><li> And other example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl">Gunslinger Girl</a></em> is the anime sequel <em>IL Teatrino</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where Triela loses during one-on-one combat for the first time against the boy assassin Pinocchio - failing her mission as a result. Through most of the series, Triela can't think of nothing else but to get revenge against Pinocchio. She finally gets the chance and kills him. But she feels empty, afterwards, realizing she might have killed a kindred spirit.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> While she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsNotMyGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsNotMyGirlfriend">wouldn't admit it</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi</a> gets pretty pissed when she catches Kyon messing around (not like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaughtWithYourPantsDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaughtWithYourPantsDown">that</a>) with Mikuru. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">It doesn't end well.</a> Except that it does. Sorta.</span>
</li><li> <em>Ichinensei Ni Nacchattara</em>: Iori's mom is still mad enough as it is about her former husband having cheated on her (leading to their divorce). When Iori <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">claims to be his love child after she figures out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">his true identity</a></span>, she's on the phone with a lawyer in <em>seconds</em>.

<ul><li> Genderflipped in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em>. Billy Katagiri took the departure of his girlfriend Lisa Kujoh <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">aka Sumeragi Lee Noriega</span> well in the second season <em>very</em> poorly. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He got better, though</span>
</li><li> Also, when Louise Halevy learned that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her former boyfriend Saji was in the 00 Raiser fighter during a skirmish</span>, her reaction was... bleak. All indications are that she's resolved to <em>kill</em> him at this point. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And she got better, too, but it was pretty close there for a minute.</span>
</li><li> Haman Karn from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em> effectively defines this trope. It is revealed that she had been in a relationship with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Char Aznable, a.k.a. Lt. Quattro</span> in the past, the specifics of which are not provided. Whether there was an actual relationship between them or if she was just infatuated and had her hopes dashed, the whole (deleted) affair left her feeling jilted and has given her a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">personality quirks</a>, which manifest themselves rather prominently when she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath">gives him her</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfICantHaveYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfICantHaveYou">ultimatum</a>. It comes as a crushing disappointment to her when he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead">refuses to capitulate</a>, and much to the detriment of the general public, she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">not really particular about whom she subjects to her</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">wrath</a>.
</li><li> Ennil El in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX">After War Gundam X</a></em> thinks she sees a kindred spirit in Garrod and starts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow">Loving a Shadow</a> in the belief that they both understand loss and abandonment. After actually meeting him, she sneaks into his room at night... unfortunately at a time when he's keyed up with justified paranoia, and he points a gun in her face. Ennil is incredibly hurt and vows revenge on him and his home ship, and spends much of the series thereafter allying herself with morally-dubious factions so she can kill him for rejecting her. (She eventually gets over this through a combination of unwittingly befriending his crewmate and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards">disgust over some of those allies</a>.)
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>, this trope is essentially the hat of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Akagi women</a>. Both are snared by Gendo and both end up worse for it.

But when Rei revealed that <em>Gendo</em> calls her that behind her back along with statements that she's no longer useful to him, Naoko flips out and commits a murder-suicide, not knowing that the Rei she killed is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues">expendable in the literal sense</a>.
</li><li> Ritsuko deludes herself that Gendo genuinely loves her instead of just having her as a mistress. When she's proven wrong, she incinerates the Rei clones and in <em>End of Evangelion</em>, she hacks the MAGI to remotely self-destruct it as a final 'up yours'... only to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">Naoko's woman personality in Casper-3 veto the order</a>.

</li><li> Asuka might count as well.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPersonConversation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPersonConversation">confrontation between Shinji and Asuka</a> that triggers Third Impact also falls under this.

The whole situation arose out of Zetsubou-sensei's paranoia of getting caught in just such a compromising situation with one (or all) of his young lady students: he used a body-double to avoid being the recipient of such unwanted attention, and the body-double proceeded not only to engage in uncharacteristic acts of charity but charmed the pants off of the cute Abiru Kobushi.

<ul><li> Hera, wife of the supreme Greek good Zeus, was the goddess of women and marriage. Being married to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves">Zeus</a>, everything she does in almost all the stories she appears in, is a reaction to his latest escapades. Being unable to go against the king of the gods directly, she usually vented her anger on anyone remotely connected to his case of unfaithfulness. Obviously, his various offspring gained her ire the most, hence why she's usually the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> in most Hercules stories. One myth said that she <em>did</em> strike against her husband directly once, getting the other Olympians to help by ambushing him while he slept, binding him with a hundred ropes and putting his weapons well out of reach. This attempted coup may have actually worked, but it had two serious flaws: First, once they had done this, they all argued among themselves over who the new ruler should be. This distracted them from the second flaw: some gods were still loyal to Zeus, like Theitis a minor goddess of the sea. While not powerful enough to challenge the other Olympians, she traveled into Tartarus to appeal to Briareus the Hecatonchire for help. The hundred-handed giant quickly untied Zeus, and Hera's coup ended quickly, resulting in a punishment that would <em>seriously</em> make her think twice about doing it again. (Bound from the edge of the heavens from her wrists with anvils chained to her ankles to weigh her down, with Zeus promising an even <em>worse</em> punishment to anyone who helped her. He eventually released her, but this <em>did</em> prevent any future attempt at a coup.)
</li><li> Upon the birth of Gaia's children the Cyclopes and Hecatonchires, Uranus hid them in a secret place within Gaia, causing her great pain.

</li><li> Another <em>Batman Beyond</em> example is from "Terry's Friend Dates a Robot": Cynthia, the robot girlfriend in question was programmed to be 100% devoted to Howard, meaning she's so possessive that she'll attempt to murder anyone who gets between her and Howard. She's so strong and fast that not even Batman was able to take her down, and he was ripping through other synthoids with little effort. The only reason she was able to be stopped was because Howard dropped the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsJustBeFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsJustBeFriends">Let's Just Be Friends</a> line, causing her to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstNuke">get so angry that she literally explodes</a>.

After an adventure with Alan in the titular boardgame, she hands the boy his homework assignment right before class, and when their teacher hands them back their assignment, she tells Judy that she did another great job on her homework, while her former crush gets a failing grade, and misses his chance to go out with the girl he likes.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder20');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder20" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> This trope set in motion a three-year criminal case in the UK involving politician Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce. The two had been happily married for 26 years, and then, in 2010, it came out that Huhne had been having an affair with his aide Carina Trimingham.
<ul><li> So Pryce revealed to the papers that someone had taken speeding points for Huhne back in 2003 (so he wouldn't get a driving ban). For non-British readers — over here that amounts to <em>obstruction of justice</em>. So, when the police checked their records to work out who had taken the rap for Huhne, they discovered that person was none other than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough">Pryce herself</a></em>. As a result, in 2012, Huhne and Pryce were both charged (with Huhne resigning his Cabinet position) after an investigation. In February 2013, Huhne plead guilty to the offence - whilst Pryce didn't, claiming the defence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">marital coercion</a> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3s14i');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3s14i" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3s14i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(in other words, by virtue of being the wife in their relationship, she could claim that her husband forced her into committing criminal acts. Note that UK courts are traditionally quite lenient towards most women in this situation, but it's usually only accepted as a mitigating factor for someone who's pleaded guilty, not as a defence in and of itself. The marital coercion defence was abolished shortly after the trial for this exact reason)</span>. The judge didn't buy it, and found her guilty as well. Both were sentenced to 8 months in prison. The judge of the case actually (almost explicitly) invoked this trope.
</li><li> Pryce wasn't the only scorned woman in this whole mess. Her friend Constance Briscoe, a high-profile lawyer and occasional judge, had seen her two prior relationships break up because her partners had cheated on her, and so she decided to help Pryce out, figuring that if she couldn't directly get revenge on her former partners, she could help Pryce get revenge on Huhne, which she did by helping her put the story together and then acting as a go-between with the press. While Briscoe hadn't broken any laws by doing this, it was nonetheless highly ethically suspect behaviour that would have hurt her legal career, and so she later denied having played any part in getting the story out. It naturally didn't take long for the police to see through the holes in her story, and so she also got charged with obstruction of justice, ended up with a prison sentence as long as Huhne and Pryce's sentences <em>combined</em>.
