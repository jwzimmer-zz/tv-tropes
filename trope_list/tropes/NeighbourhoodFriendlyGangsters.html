Since racketeering, random murders and selling drugs don't really fly with the general public, heroic criminals in fiction are usually Neighbourhood Friendly Gangsters.
</p><p>There is truth to this, particularly in the birthplace of the mob, Sicily. Eventually, the locals of that harried island got tired of being invaded every other week and banded together with the local gangsters. The same goes for Harlem during the Civil Rights Struggle, which saw its share of unfair treatment by police. The Japanese <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a> tend to be more civilized to their neighbors as well since they tend to operate more openly than Western counterparts and like to preach how they provide "services" to the community (who, in return, owe them money and respect).

Neighbourhood-Friendly Gangsters almost always have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">standards</a>; refusing to deal hard drugs is a common one. This may include a noble (if warped) sense of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyValuesVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyValuesVillain">family values</a>.
</p><p>This trope has some elements of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>: crime syndicates that wish to survive in a community try to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">good public relations</a>, after the philosophy "don't shit where you eat". Many criminal organizations (including the Japanese <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">yakuza</a>, Sicilian Mafia, the Chinese triad societies, and most American street gangs) also have their roots in community self-defense efforts, although they share a strong tendency to degenerate into more euphemistic "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionRacket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionRacket">protection</a>" among other abuses. Moreover, having an organised crime outfit in your neighborhood tends to help cut down on <em>dis</em>organized crimethe common criminals who might otherwise commit crimes in that neighborhood are too afraid of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobbingTheMobBank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobbingTheMobBank">committing a crime against the wrong person</a>, and <em>paying</em> for it, or pissing off people who have every reason to keep the neighborhood off the radar.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo">Vento Aureo</a></em> has Bucciarati's group within the Passione mafia, a group which carries the arc protagonist, Giorno, as its newest member. Unlike the rest of Passione (who are decidedly <em>not</em> neighborhood-friendly), Bucciarati's group is beloved by the general community, with even old people willingly going to them, a group of rogues with supernatural abilities and trouble surrounding them, for help. Bucciarati and Giorno only joined up with Passione in the first place to stop the mafia from dealing drugs, and their goal is to overthrow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDon">The Don</a> of Passione and insert one of their own in his place. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In fact, they outright openly rebel and gun for him when they learn the hard way that he is willing to kill his own daughter only because of the insane paranoid idea that she could be a clue to his identity, despite having never met the man in her life nor know anything about him. The personal targeting of an innocent and unrelated teenage girl was the last straw</span>.
</li><li> Giorno got into crime because of one of these. When he was a child, regularly bullied and abused, he found a man bleeding out in a patch of tall grass. The men who'd shot him asked Giorno where the man had gone, and Giorno lied, saving the injured man's life. That man was a powerful gangster in Naples, and after he recovered he made it a point to protect Giorno from a distance (his first act: having a "quick talk" with Giorno's abusive stepfather). The only person who <em>ever</em> treated Giorno well was in the Mafia, and that inspired him to go the same route.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em> doesn't really touch at all on the crime-for-profit element of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">The Mafia</a> (except for a few mentions of speakeasies), and its mobster characters might as well be violent aristocrats given their behavior and portrayal. The light novels <em>do</em> go a bit more into crime, with the Genoard fortune coming from cocaine and the Gandors being explicitly opposed to drug dealing. Of course, this only reinforces which characters are Neighbourhood-Friendly Gangsters. Also, Jacuzzi and Nice run a crew of community-minded delinquents.
</li><li> Yusuke from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em> is a Neighbourhood Friendly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Delinquents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Delinquents">Punk</a> who shoplifts, smokes, gambles, and gets into fights for fun.
</li><li> The Kuroda group in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gokusen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gokusen">Gokusen</a></em> is like this. They still like a good fight and get most of their resources from illegal gambling and protection of hostess bars. Though unlike others they don't just get protection money to extort them, they really do protect them.
</li><li> The Washimine group of the "Fujiyama Gangsta Paradise" arc in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em> is an ethical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a>, fighting an uphill battle against more ruthless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Delinquents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Delinquents">Delinquents</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafiya">The Mafiya</a> headed by Balalaika. Ginji Matsuzaki, the <em>wakagashira</em> and resident badass of the group, comments that while they're impoverished, it's more honourable than "selling women and meth."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em>, for the first 8 volumes, is a wacky comedy where the cast is supposed to be a Mafia family. They're really more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> than anything else.
<ul><li> Then the other part of their family show that they are <em>not</em> Friendly and engages in the battle for succession of the boss title.
</li><li> Later, another mafia family is introduced. This one (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">in the future</a>) has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">taken over the world</a>.
</li><li> And the latest flashbacks reveal that the protagonist's family in its first generation was a <em>vigilante</em> group, and only later has been turned into a full-blown mafia family.
</li></ul></li><li> The Dollars in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em> are something of an example, whether they're a gang, a neighbourhood watch organisation, or just a group of random anonymous people depends on how you look at it. Also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Kida ruled them</span> the Yellow Scarves were this, at least in comparison to Blue Square.
</li><li> The Yakuza of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutakoiAlternative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutakoiAlternative">Futakoi Alternative</a></em>. Granted, when compared to biomechanical flying pyromaniac squid, simple Yakuza seem pretty tame.
</li><li> HOMRA in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/K" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/K">K</a></em> gives off a strong street-gangster vibe and can often be rude to innocents, but they never intentionally do something evil. Their actions are mostly pushed by their close bonds and their instincts to protect and stick up for members of the gang.
</li><li> Souchirou's gang in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HeavensMemoPad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HeavensMemoPad">Heaven's Memo Pad</a></em> started as he and a few other delinquent punks getting together to protect themselves and those they cared about against other gangs, and grew from there. They're still small and realize they can't keep doing the gang thing forever, and so have been exploring more legitimate services like managing and promoting shows for bands at local clubs. They are also very down on most drugs, and Souchirou helps the heroes find and stop the source of a dangerous new euphoric drug circulating among the poor and disaffected in their area.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KoreanWebtoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KoreanWebtoon">Korean Webtoon</a> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloHellper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloHellper">Hello Hellper</a></em> has the Killberos group whose leader Gwangnam absolutely forbids gangster-like behavior. For example, they don't take payment for their protection services, they earn money legitimately through concerts and selling their own brand of clothes, and as a rule, each member must never <em>ever</em> involve the rest of the group in their personal issues. Unfortunately, the story starts with Gwangnam dying and eventually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> several violent members, including one who was expelled, take over so they can make Killberos into a "real" gang while those who upheld Gwangnam's peaceful ideals are overpowered, turned to the dark side, or even killed (technically not yet but getting stabbed in the gut is probably not a good thing)</span>.
<ul><li> The other gangs in the story, be they groups of middle-schoolers or full-blown Korean mafiosos, are absolutely <em>not</em> friendly although a few of the elders had a healthy respect/fear of a certain woman nicknamed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">"Blood Ocean"</a> and stayed out of town <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "Blood Ocean" also happens to be Gwangnam's foster grandmother; unfortunately she also died and now there's nothing stopping them from encroaching onto Gwangnam's town</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KyouKaraOreWa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KyouKaraOreWa">Kyou Kara Ore wa!!</a></em>, Mitsuhashi and Itou are neighborhood-friendly <em>punks</em>: they rose as the strongest delinquent students of Chiba as an unintended consequence of deciding to reinvent their image in a cooler way upon moving there (<a class="urllink" href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7a/0b/b1/7a0bb18351bf290dd90b1d5db004fa96.jpg">Mitsuhashi is the blond<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>) and being stronger than anyone who tried to beat them up for it, with Itou being a genuinely good person and Mitsuhashi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">incredibly greedy and selfish but willing to help his friends and protect his school from worse delinquents</a> and never did anything worse than getting his worst enemies hospitalized or some vandalism.
<ul><li> The series offers a few other examples: the gang at Itou and Mitsuhashi's school isn't too bad (partly out of admiration for Itou, partly out of fear of what Mitsuhashi would do them if they inconvenienced him.

They deal in the vice industry but don't force anyone to take their wares. They demand protection money but actually deliver on protecting the businesses. They carry out assassinations, but generally only on fellow power-players. If you're a common citizen who keeps his nose clean, you have virtually nothing to fear.

<ul><li> The Thieves Guild of Ankh-Morpork 'has standards' and arranges crime in mutually beneficial forms (as far as crime goes): rich people pay an annual premium, and arrange for a convenient date to rob an acceptable amount from these rich clients in their own home. Poorer (but not penniless) citizens are robbed in a fairly polite fashion on the streets, their business premises or homes, are not badly injured, and are given a receipt which guarantees they won't suffer another official robbery for the rest of the year. Criminals who don't keep to this arrangement, or who don't display their license when on business, are dealt with by the Watch if they're lucky... or by the Thieves' Guild if they're <em>unlucky</em>.
</li><li> The Troll criminal organisation "Breccia" also fits the mold, even though they are pretty ruthless. Chrysoprase helps Vimes prevent riots on Koom Valley Day by revealing a drug lab.
<ul><li> That's because the drug manufactured there would cause homicidal insanity, and later death. Chrysoprase wants stable business, which is rather hard with dead customers. Breccia is an extremely ruthless Mafia organization - but they don't want to rock the boat too much and destroy their own chances of getting rich(er).

Each is depicted as being essentially driven by good business sense rather than cruelty. Stragen in particular had taught his Guild to prey more upon the aristocracy than the common folk.
</li><li> The hooligans in <em>Football Factory</em> are pretty close to a organized crime group, and even sell some drugs, but are decent people for the most part, with a code of honour to only fight with other hooligans and the "old bill".

Vito protects his neighbors and friends from the technically legal ripoffs of unscrupulous "legit" businessmen. And, when he moves out to the suburbs, he and Sonny use their skills against disorganized crime to the point that, to quote the text, "Long Beach became a model city."

They'll take care of you and your family, and will represent your interests when Necessarius comes calling. Some are less so, though. The Nosferatu, for instance, are basically just a bunch of gangs with a vaguely common theme, and the Nessians are mentioned several times to be nothing but slavers.
</li><li> Necessarius, the biggest gang in the city, effectively <em>is</em> the government. They collect protection money instead of taxes, but otherwise are the same, and are in charge of keeping the cultures from getting too violent and enforcing laws. They're even implied to be in charge of civil planning and repair, judging by some of Butler's reactions to the destruction caused by the events of the story. They even coordinate elections, both for the senators for individual districts and the boss of Necessarius itself—though the latter position appears to be mostly permanent, it is apparently theoretically possible to depose him legally.

Eventually, her old friend Piranha Jones gets her and Shades hooked up with a lucrative stock deal wherein they purchase large shares of Atreus Plastics stock as it gets acquired by Glenn Industries, intimidating the company CEO Mark Higgins into approving the merger.

However, the game makes it clear that although the King himself is a genuinely good person who cares deeply about the members of his gang and the people of Freeside, there are some in the gang (especially his right-hand man Pacer) who are really just in it for power and the opportunity to feel important.

Olivia Marcano, meanwhile, is a socialite and a major fixture of New Bordeaux's high society, supporting a scholarship program with Remy Duvall, himself an example of this trope who puts on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernGentleman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernGentleman">Southern Gentleman</a> image on his talk radio show. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Make no mistake, though</a>: they are just as ruthless and degenerate as any other leaders in the Marcano crime family.

The gangs are trying to sabotage the candidacy of Robert Harper, and even disrupt his campaign events and wreck a stage with him on it. With the local police unable to get a handle on things, the Joes are sent in by the President to make sure the city can elect a new Mayor without the gangs' interference. Then the Joes discover that Harper and the gangs are both pawns of Cobra. Harper has made an alliance with Cobra and promised to be their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing">puppet Mayor</a> once elected. The gangs are secretly being manipulated by Cobra's agents to disrupt Harper's campaign because Cobra knows this will only <em>increase</em> support and sympathy for Harper. After this, the Joes try to recruit the same gangs they initially were sent to fight to their side by revealing the conspiracy to them. The gangs ultimately turn on Cobra when they find out and when they nearly prevented one of their members from rescuing her little brother from a fire. While the episode makes it clear these were bad kids prior to Cobra's conspiracy, they do ultimately do the right thing and the ending seems to indicate that they've seen the error of their ways and will be a more positive force in their community.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlCapone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlCapone">Al Capone</a> had soup lines set up in Chicago during the Great Depression. He had a soft spot for children, once trying to see that they got good milk (this actually led to the creation of expiration dates on food!) and telling a paperboy to take the day off before handing him 20 bucks. Ironically, the supplies for Al Capone's soup kitchens were acquired by threatening bakeries, packinghouses, and other food suppliers if they didn't meet the quota the gangsters demanded. Al himself also tried to endear himself to Chicago, such as paying the rents of poor tenants, and had a reputation for magnificent PR skills. He succeeded fairly well, and it appears that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask">he actually enjoyed helping the city out</a> when not ordering the assassinations of potential threats to him.

</li><li> In return for release from prison and deportation, Lucky Luciano supposedly used his underworld connections to provide aid against Mussolini's regime in Italy as well as keep American docks free of strikes and sabotage. There is debate, however, about whether he actually provided any worthwhile aid or whether it was all a scam on his own country during a time of war.
</li><li> Sicilian gangsters and separatists (the two weren't always distinct) provided material and intelligence aid to the Allies during the WWII invasion of Sicily. This was hardly altruistic, though; Mussolini had severely cracked down on the Sicilian Mafia and the gangsters used the war as a means to regain their traditional power.
<ul><li> Luciano's cohort, Meyer Lansky, organized squads of gangsters to protect Jewish communities in New York City against the German-American Bund and other pro-fascist groups antagonizing Jews during the '30s.
</li></ul></li><li> Frankie Yale was known for generosity toward the less fortunate people in Brooklyn, who often approached him for financial assistance. When a local delicatessen owner was robbed, Yale replaced his lost cash. When a fish peddler lost his cart, Yale gave him $200 with an admonition to get a horse. Conversely, Yale was a violent man who did not hesitate to inflict pain on others, including his own brother.
<p></p></li><li> Chicago sociologist Sudhir Venkatesh spent years researching the Black Disciples Nation crack cocaine gang, and noticed they spent a part of their income to hold block parties and paid the families of dead members. The leader of the gang explained that they didn't want to be seen as a scourge to the community, rather a pillar.
</li><li> During the days immediately following Martin Luther King's assassination, there were horrific riots on the West Side of Chicago. Of course, rioting was a very mild term-the entire black population pretty much <em>declared war on the police.</em> The South Side, which was generally considered a much more dangerous area was not subject to rioting because the two large and powerful gangs (whose power struggle was what made it such a dangerous area in the first place) the Blackstone Rangers and the Disciples, cooperated to keep it calm.

</li><li> African-American street gangs such as the Crips originally started as informal youth-oriented "street clubs" intended to protect the immediate community and counter the effects of the racism (both overt and institutional) that was pervasive in the mid-20th century.
</li><li> The notorious MS-13 gang in Los Angeles was started by Salvadoran immigrants in response to attacks and intimidation by already-established Mexican and African-American gangs.
</li><li> Many South-American gangs with large amounts of profit from drugs provide better safety and security to locals than the government themselves would.
</li><li> The Yamaguchi-<em>gumi</em>, the largest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a> gang in Japan, is headquartered in Kobe; during the earthquake in 1995, they donated money and a helicopter to the relief effort and had their men rescuing people from the rubble. This trope is actually a part of their traditional code since they considered themselves protectors of their communities. Many yakuza traditions go back to vigilante groups in the early Edo period.
<ul><li> The Yakuza were a major contributor to the rebuilding of Japan after WWII's devastation. It's one of the primary reasons why they gained the power to go from small-time gangs to the corporate-level organizations they are today.
</li><li> And the cleanup and assistance crews at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster zone are also heavily composed of yakuza. While it's scandalous and worrisome in some ways, and likely an attempt at good publicity, they <em>are</em> doing work that a lot of people <em>would absolutely refuse to do</em> out of justified fear of radiation risks to their health.
<ul><li> There is a practical side to it as well. While <em>some</em> Yakuza syndicates have the audacity and the clout to operate by their own names, most are fronted by the same legal company, and traditionally these fronts are in construction and cleaning industry, which are more-or-less completely Yakuza-controlled in Japan. So it is only natural for them to be involved in the cleanup effort. Moreover, it is not that the mobsters are personally shoveling radioactive waste, most of their involvement is in hiring local bums on a shoestring pay, and sending them to Fukushima to work.

</li><li> Many of the Mexican drug cartels (especially the old-school ones) could pass as this, with the exception of the Zetas which are relatively new and known for their utter ruthlessness:
<ul><li> The former drug lord Malherbe is regarded as a great benefactor of his home village, paving the streets and building schools and hospitals.
</li><li> Osiel Cardenas, the head of the Gulf Cartel, even after his capture sent trucks filled with toys, clowns and magicians to the children of impoverished neighborhoods and slums every Children's Day (April 30), he even included greeting cards encouraging the children from there to go to school, study and work hard.
</li><li> In the towns afflicted by the Drug War the members of the Gulf Cartel reportedly assist people looking for directions and give warnings about violent outbreaks, always reminding them that they are "Here to protect you".
</li></ul></li><li> Apocryphally, word has it that petty street crime rose considerably in some neighborhoods of New York City after the FBI successfully disrupted some major organized crime outfits.
</li><li> Henry Hill in his autobiography 'Wiseguy' describes the unfortunate fate of a young black would-be mugger who tried to ply his trade in a mob-controlled neighborhood.
</li><li> The Loomis Family, a notorious clan of criminals in nineteenth-century central New York State, made a point of not only <em>not</em> stealing, or allowing their associates to steal, from neighbors, but helping them get goods back that were stolen by others. Allowing this arrangement to break down was one of the reasons the neighbors ended up turning against them.
</li><li> In the non-fiction book <em>Chinatown Gangs: Extortion, Enterprise, and Ethnicity</em>, author Ko-Lin Chin notes that many Chinese youth gangs are like this. They even have specific rules about how to treat those from whom they extort money. (For example, they generally won't trash a place of business simply because the owner fails to pay protection money one time, as such action is bad for public relations.)
</li><li> Comando Vermelho (or Red Command), is a narcotic distribution gang that initially began as a communist organization (Falange Vermelha) as its two Marxist founders bonded in prison. Although decimated in 2010 by a government purge into the Favela slums of Rio (namely Cidade de Deus) CV are still powerful enough to hold public techno rave parties, sports meets and other such mass celebrations that attract youth. In addition, CV publishes popular funk rave music that can be found in the streets of the Favela, and it's forbidden prohibitive nature has been very lucrative for Funk artists. The group honors slain members and promotes its ideals, particularly against the war on drugs. CV like most drug gangs have also used social media such as Facebook to spread its ideals and romanticize the thug life. The CV also promote themselves as militia defenders of the residents of the Favelas against the corrupt and oppressive police and extortion.
</li><li> While cops and organized criminals generally like to stay apart, often the organized criminals will aid the police when a cop is killed because while the cops are bad for business already, dead cops set the police on the warpath, which is even worse.
</li><li> The BBC TV drama <em>Doing Money</em> gives the account of a Romanian woman who is kidnapped and sex trafficked by a Romanian gang. She and another woman are rescued by a local Irish Drug gang in Belfast who are outraged by the kidnapping and abuse the women have undergone (and are also annoyed when they hear that this gang now considers Belfast "their town"). They pistol whip and viciously beat the gang and run them out of town. The woman is then able to go to the police as she is no longer terrified of the Romanian gang and they ultimately convict the pimps.
</li><li> The notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LondonGangster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LondonGangster">Kray twins</a> made the single largest donation to the relief fund of the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberfan_disaster">Aberfan disaster<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (£100, equivalent to around £3000 today) as well as donating to many other charities, and were viewed as successful and charming celebrities who mingled with socialites, politicians, and performers such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyGarland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyGarland">Judy Garland</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BarbaraWindsor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BarbaraWindsor">Barbara Windsor</a>.
</li><li> Notorious Chicago street gang the Vice Lords turned into this in the 1960s with the founding of their offshoot the Conservative Vice Lords, who founded legitimate businesses (with federal funds!), engaged in community service, and protected local residents from abuse by slum lords. Sadly this productive period did not continue, and eventually the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CVLs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CVLs">CV Ls</a> reverted back into a violent street gang.
