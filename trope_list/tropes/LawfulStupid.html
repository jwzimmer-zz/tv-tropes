</p><p>In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGames">tabletop roleplaying games</a>, it's such a common behavior for paladins that it seems <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">this is what everyone</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">expects</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">paladins to do these days</a>. The reason for this has to do with game mechanics, along with a lot of inexperienced players failing to understand the difference between Intelligence and Wisdom. Paladins basically require three high scores to be in any way useful: Intelligence is not one of those scores. The way this is <em>supposed</em> to work out is that Paladins don't spend much time reading books, but have quite a bit of in-the-field experience (so, they should actually be able to handle this kind of philosophical dilemma pretty well). In fact, it's <em>so</em> common that the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sourcebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sourcebook">Sourcebook</a> <em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em> spends a good number of pages explaining how to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral">Lawful Neutral</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> <em>without</em> being a dimwit. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterRevolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterRevolt">The creators themselves</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterRevolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterRevolt">got sick of it</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note07ban');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note07ban" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note07ban');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">However, they kind of failed, as the <em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em> is derisively referred to by players as <em>Book of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidGood">Stupidly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbIsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbIsGood">Dumb Good</a></em> because of how they handle Good and Evil in said book. Its companion piece the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> doesn't help matters.</span> Of course, this could be justified if the paladin in question belongs to a specific church.

Remember, however, that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad">Tropes Are Not Bad</a>. When properly used, this trope can actually be used to add depth to a character rather than reduce them to a farce:
</p><ul><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral">Lawful Neutral</a> character strongly supports an authority, a governing body, or a personal set of principles and doesn't care much about good or evil  this makes them prone to <em>both</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindObedience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindObedience">Blind Obedience</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo">doing what they decide needs to be done</a>.
</li><li> A truly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> character, on the other hand, believes that a lawful, orderly society is necessary for the good of all and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a> is a virtue, not a vice. They may see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual">all crimes as equal</a> because even breaking a minor law hurts the greater good in some way, and cannot go unpunished  one stolen loaf of bread may seem a petty offense, but if thousands are stolen across a city every day, every baker will be ruined. On the other hand, many a Lawful Good character would argue against that sort of thinking as well. And in the most extreme cases of a lawful good holding the idiot ball, where a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice">completely unnecessary and pointless</a>, they would rather die in a futile gesture or acting upon incorrect information doing what they believed was right than live having done nothing. Although again, not necessarily true of every Lawful Good character.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> characters may seem unlikely to be vulnerable to this, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">Even Evil Has Standards</a>. Many a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Noble Demon</a> has met their downfall because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord">I Gave My Word</a>. Others may have no problem with harming "players in the game" but not innocents, which may leave them vulnerable to deception. Stranger still: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executives</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackKnight">Black Knights</a> might do anything within the rules to further their ambitions, but the suggestion of even a minor actual violation of the law or their personal code is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a>.

<ul><li> The World Government is ruled by a bunch of arrogant nobles who are not only perfectly willing to ignore a prison breakout that freed more than one hundred highly dangerous criminals back into the world, they are willing to cover it up as though it never happened. While focusing nearly the entirety of their forces into one single place to ensure the end of the bloodline of a decades-dead pirate. (Possibly an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItSeemedLikeAGoodIdeaAtTheTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItSeemedLikeAGoodIdeaAtTheTime">It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time</a>, as the reason for the cover-up of the prison break out was that after already taking a hit to their reputation, they didn't want to announce that their formerly impenetrable prison just had a massive break out and cause a panic/queue more trouble. That said, one has to wonder how you talk your way out of formerly imprisoned criminals suddenly appearing in the world. Besides, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch">they can kill anyone who can prove they got out.</a> Or so they assume. The World Government tends to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem">Screw the Rules, I Make Them!</a> attitude at times.)
</li><li> Admiral Kizaru <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">is less evil than his bosses</a>, but he tends to be this, emphasis on "stupid." He can't tell the difference between the "black" Den Den Mushi, only used for espionage, and the standard Den Den Mushi used as a phone, completely overlooks slavery, and its many implications, and nearly destroyed an entire island in the Saobody Archipelago because he couldn't be bothered to check where he was aiming.
</li></ul></li><li> Suzaku Kururugi of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, who believes upholding the law is a better path towards change than revolution, even though said laws apply to a Darwinist government that would sooner keel over than give its so-called Numbers equal rights. Until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan">dark past</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">secret motive</a> are revealed</span>, and he more appropriately falls under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral">Lawful Neutral</a>.
<ul><li> During a hostage situation, Suzaku actually protests against hacking open a locked door to save someone because "it's against the rules."
</li><li> He does have one reasonable point, though... The ease with which Britannia conquers Japan and the many years of failure that the Japanese resistance undergoes leaves Suzaku beyond believing that it's possible. The fairly easily accomplished defeat of the European superpower, and China's near submission, strongly suggest that he's right. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Once Lelouch accidentally destroys one of the best perceivable hopes for the happiness of the Japanese, though still a little slim, Suzaku becomes beyond believing that anything Lelouch does is good.</span> Suzaku finally comes around after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">accidentally nuking Tokyo</span> though.
<ul><li> This is, of course, debatable as Suzaku <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">initially</span> strongly adheres to the notion that the ends dont justify the means, and Lelouch as Zero proves capable of nearly overthrowing Britannias rule over Japan several times if not precisely for Suzakus interference; proving it to indeed be possible. It thus indicates that even if change were achieved by rebellion, Suzaku would dismiss it as worthless because the means of doing so went against the law and current established authority, conveniently ignoring that said law and authority is designed so there's no legal way of doing so.

He cited the Pokémon League rules as why in the third episode. This is despite the fact that his battles with Team Rocket have nothing to do with the Pokémon League. He would eventually get over this.

They try to justify their persecution of her in that the Pandoras are humanity's best line of defense against the monstrous, alien Novas, and that in battle, unit cohesion and the chain of command have to be maintained. What makes this truly stupid, though, is that none of them seem to care that the 3rd-year that Satellizer beat up had forcefully disrobed her and taken pictures of it, and was ready to have her male assistants <em>rape</em> Satellizer. And then it turns out that all Pandoras are expected to act Lawful Stupid by the government and anyone who acts out of line would be horrifically punished. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Just ask Elizabeth.</span>

The main character is tricked into signing a contract to act as an evil organization's super-villain and never thinks that since the signature was made under false pretenses, it's invalid. Plus just ignoring it even if it were legal. Thankfully, Jackal isn't really all that evil, so it's not so bad.
</li><li> Early on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Slayers">Slayers</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">Amelia's</a> obsession with being a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForGreatJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForGreatJustice">Hero of Justice</a>" could lead to this. Highlights include turning against Lina and Gourry when she learns that there is a (fake) bounty on their heads and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spot</a> in which she blasts someone with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNuke">Dragon Slave</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">picking up a lost quarter</a>.</em> She does relax her standards eventually, though.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheTwelveKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheTwelveKingdoms">The Twelve Kingdoms</a></em>, a flashback shows us King Chuutatsu of Hou. He was chosen for the job by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidGood">Hourin</a> for his strong sense of justice. Unfortunately, it turned out to be <em>too</em> strong. He eventually decreed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual">All Crimes Are Equal</a> and that someone guilty of a crime  <em><strong>any</strong></em> crime  would be put to death by crucifixion (turns out Hou was the only one of the Kingdoms to still do so). The situation was not helped by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">his Queen</a> falsely accusing officials and women of Court she didn't like just to be rid of them. After thirty years and hundreds of thousands of citizens put to death, his remaining officials revolted and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHerHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHerHead">beheaded him, the Queen, AND the dying Hourin</a>, though the latter could also count as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a>. The King's 13-year-old (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">actually 43</a>) daughter was the only survivor, and her learning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating">what people really thought of the King</a> is the catalyst for her finally maturing.
</li><li> Haruka from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaiHime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaiHime">Mai Hime</a></em> manga, who is on a quest to expel the Orphan Resistance Unit from the school. Interestingly enough, though, she resorts to kidnapping, attempted theft of Elements, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedCrook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedCrook">recruiting known troublemakers like Nao</a> to advance her agenda.
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, Isono (an employee of Kaiba's who acts as a referee during the Battle City finals) is a borderline example. He sticks adamantly to the rules of the game, even though something is obviously wrong (as in, Marik's demonic presence risking everyone's lives), and makes every call by the book. For example, a deleted scene from Yugi's duel with Marik has him rule that Yugi's drawing a card and setting it without confirming it is not allowed (if it's a monster, it's in the wrong slot), even though Yugi has a good reason for this. (Kaiba himself, however, overrules this ruling, saying it's "interesting", and the duel continues.) The worst example is when he forbids Yugi from helping Bakura, even though Bakura was <em>dying</em> because a duelist isn't allowed to make physical contact with an opponent.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL">Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL</a></em>, Takashi is appointed leader of the School Disciplinary Squad by the Student Council President and takes this job way too far. When Yuma is challenged to a duel by the President, Takashi forbids Yuma from using Gagaga Girl because her outfit <em>violates the school dress code</em>. (Never mind that a ruling like this would be considered outright cheating in the actual card game.) In Takashi's defense, when he realizes that the President is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a> minion of the Barians who has been using him, he quickly resigns from his position, and Yuma is able to use any cards he wants from that point.

</li><li> Shown as a flaw in the hero system (albeit for laughs) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan">One-Punch Man</a></em>, as C-class heroes need to do one good deed a week in order to keep their status, and his fights tend to not take place in public areas or get reported unless a fellow hero is there. Saitama was not aware of that, and was informed of it by his ally Genos when there was <em>half a day left</em>. The result was not him doing a good deed, but running around and scaring everyone with the expression on his face looking for one.

</li><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a> story arc, a man who felt the justice system had failed summons a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">Literal Genie</a> demons to enforce the law of his city. They twist their commands around so the slightest infraction allows them to slaughter with impunity.
</li><li> Despite himself being a criminal, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a> is sometimes depicted as willing to kill anyone who breaks any law for any reason, even if the "criminal" is non-violent, begging for mercy, and just helped the Punisher. In one instance, he discovered that someone who had been his ally throughout the issue was a retired thief, and, as a sign of gratitude for his help, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyLead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyLead">gave him a head start</a>. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>, as older writers often showed him willing to let a criminal go if they gave him a reason. One of the very first Punisher stories shows him murdering people for littering. When the decision was made to recast him as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>, this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> into having been drugged by an enemy.
</li><li> While Punisher's lawful stupidity varies by the author, Solo, whose motto is "while I live, terror dies", was woven whole from lawful moron cloth. He's shown in a Solo story to shoot down a murderer, then turns around and gives the would-be victim he has just rescued his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">twisted reasoning</a> for why his previous actions have actually prompted the murder attempt to occur, then kills the guy himself for "creating terror". Marvel execs probably wonder to this day <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">why he never caught on.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> has an enemy named Cardiac, a high-tech <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> who exists simply to punish people who escape justice <em>because</em> of this Trope.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSpectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSpectre">The Spectre</a> falls under this trope from time to time, mostly because he is vengeance personified and thus prone to being tricked. Given his power, this is a <em>very</em> bad thing. This is why he is usually bound to a human host; both to limit his power and to give him some much-needed perspective.
</li><li> Sam from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SamAndMaxFreelancePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SamAndMaxFreelancePolice">Sam &amp; Max: Freelance Police</a></em> is this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">for</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy">laughs</a>. He genuinely loves justice, but his ways of achieving justice are batshit insane and mostly an excuse to charge around, shooting at things.
</li><li> From the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> comic Titan:
<div class="indent">"<strong>Authority must be respected! Orders are sacrosanct! Hekate disobeyed! Better that-</strong>" <br/>"B-better that this depot and every life in it had <strong>fallen</strong> than I had <strong>disobeyed your order?</strong>" <br/>"As the Emperor is my judge...<strong>yes.</strong>"
</div></li><li> Despite being a satire of zero-tolerance policy, the whole premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em> runs on this. However, while initially Dredd was certainly like this, with incidents such as victims often being arrested for minor acts committed while being the victims of greater crimes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">as time progressed Dredd grew more of a conscience</a> and has been known to bend, oppose and, on occasion, flout the law if the situation appeared to warrant it. The later overturning of Mega-City One's mutant laws is a good example of this.
<ul><li> It's worth noting that the comic actually started out on a far less satirical note, with Dredd (and his fellow Judges) being far more idealistic. A very early comic had him risk his life to save a child, then telling a recruit that a Judge must be willing to sacrifice himself to protect a citizen. Later comics treated citizens as completely expendable, sometimes with the justification that they were just potential lawbreakers.
</li><li> The Dark Judges can be seen as this trope NOT played for laughs. Initially, they were strict enforcers of the law but took it to the extreme of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual">All Crimes Are Equal</a>, and eventually decided that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">since all crimes are committed by the living, then all life should be a crime</a>. The concept of killing people for jaywalking or littering seems ridiculous, even darkly humorous to anyone sane, but it's a whole other ballgame when the entities doing it are more than capable of killing <em>entire planets</em>, which <em><strong>they have</strong></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> You might even accuse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman">Batman</a> himself of acting this way in <em>Joker: Devil's Advocate</em>. Batman actually tries to <em>defend</em> the Joker when it seems that he may actually finally face execution, on the grounds that Batman believes he's innocent of the crime he's currently being accused of. He <em>is</em> innocent of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMeThisTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMeThisTime">this</a></em> crime, but <em>come on</em>. The Joker had murdered Jason Todd, crippled Barbara Gordon, and has committed hundreds of other murders that he remains completely unrepentant for. If Batman wonders why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity">Joker Immunity</a> Trope got its name, maybe he should start blaming himself.
<ul><li> Batman did get the last laugh on the Joker at the end of the story. The villain was more mortified and humiliated than he had <em>ever</em> been when Batman told him that <em>his</em> investigation was what had saved his life. Although under most writers, Joker would be more likely to taunt Batman about the fact rather than the other way around.
</li><li> In Batman's defense, letting the Joker fry for a murder he didn't commit also would have complicated bringing the actual murderer to justice.
</li></ul></li><li> General Ross is probably the <em>embodiment</em> of this Trope. His lifelong goal — some would say obsession — to bring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHulk">the Hulk</a> to justice has likely <em>caused</em> more property damage and casualties than he ever could have prevented had he succeeded, and likely cost the U.S. Army a fortune, all without any success. The Hulk is one of the strongest humanoid beings in the Marvel Universe, capable of hefting a battleship over his head, and making him angry just makes him stronger (as Ross clearly knows after all this time), so you'd think that when he shouts <strong>"LEAVE HULK ALONE!!"</strong>, Ross would get the hint.
<ul><li> This is taken to the most extreme conclusion when he becomes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHulk">Red Hulk</a> in order to pursue his goal, becoming, in many ways, even worse than his quarry. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> described the Red Hulk as "The kind of Hulk we haven't seen before. A thinking, calculating, brutal weapon-toting kind of Hulk." Not that this is a good thing. Ross was more than capable of murder, destroyed the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, and nearly wrecked San Francisco, proving that, despite being able to think, he was just as destructive.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIlluminati" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIlluminati">The Illuminati</a> gravitates into this territory a <em>lot</em> of times, particularly with their egregious handling of the Hulk on several occasions. They were also ready to pronounce a death sentence on the Scarlet Witch because of her increasing insanity <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and as <em>Children's Crusade</em> ended up revealing that they'd been completely oblivious to the fact that her insanity had been orchestrated and manipulated by a supervillain</span>. When Wiccan of the Young Avengers starts displaying even the slightest bit of lack of control over his powers, they come to the immediate conclusion that he's just as unstable as the Scarlet Witch for no other reason than being the Scarlet Witch's son.
<ul><li> In all fairness, Wanda had killed 3 Avengers by the time the team was seriously considering putting her down, manipulation or no. And all the Avengers were doing with Wiccan was monitoring his powers to make sure another M Day wouldn't happen. It only went farther than that after the Young Avengers broke him out, and Wolverine was the only one actually out for his blood after that.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SHIELD">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> was living and breathing this trope during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CivilWar">Civil War</a>. Anyone who opposed the Superhuman Registration Act was seen as the enemy and when caught were sentenced to a concentration camp in another dimension. They even hired <em>supervillains</em> to hunt down the rebel superheroes.
<ul><li> That's mostly due to the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MariaHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MariaHill">Maria Hill</a>, who tends to be the absolute epitome of Lawful Stupid, was running S.H.I.E.L.D. during that arc. In fact, it was the entire reason she was chosen to replace Nick Fury. The government knew she was completely incapable of questioning or disobeying orders. Unfortunately, this trope was also Maria's undoing when she allowed Norman Osborn full rein. The scene where she attempts to arrest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> for "breaking" a law which is still being debated in Congress at the time (i.e. is NOT a law yet) is textbook Lawful Stupid with a side order of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou">Holier Than Thou</a> on Hill's part.
<ul><li> Trope happily averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></em> live-action TV series where Maria <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">helps Coulson attack the US army (who she was co-operating with for immunity from S.H.I.E.L.D.'s terrorist label so that she could work privately for Stark) so that he can escape and continue to pursue Hydra.</span>
</li><li> And before that, when told by the President of the USA to nuke Genosha while the Avengers are on it, she refuses, even though at that point her relationship with the group was decidedly frosty.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Not</em> the first time S.H.I.E.L.D. had done something idiotic like this. In the <em>She-Hulk</em> graphic novel, they used their authority to <em>kidnap</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk">She-Hulk</a> in order to subject her to experiments to make sure she wasn't as dangerous as the Hulk. (Nick Fury objected, but he wasn't in charge at that point.) End result? An incompetent officer took control of the project, a mutant swarm of cockroaches hijacked control of the Helicarrier (this was the original one) the Helicarrier was destroyed, and they barely avoided a nuclear disaster due to the crash causing its reactor to become unstable. (She-Hulk would have left them to their fates, but there was a town with innocent civilians that would have been destroyed too, so they were able to convince her to fix the problem. Still, they didn't learn...)
</li><li> Oh, yeah, they didn't learn. Another example of SHIELD stupidity happened slightly after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga">The Clone Saga</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> one-shot <em>Spider-Man: Dead Man's Hand</em>, when they confiscated the Jackal's body and experimented on it. This led to an unscrupulous coroner who they <em>clearly</em> shouldn't have given the job to finding out the secrets of the Carrion Virus and turning himself into the third - and to date, deadliest - version of Carrion, who tried to unleash <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">a biochemical weapon</a> on New York to create a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a>. (Sort of; the victims weren't truly zombies.) Spider-Man told Dum Dum Dugan to his face that "This would <em>never</em> be happening if Nick Fury were alive!" which clearly didn't help matters. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ironically, Fury <em>was</em> alive, but had faked his death, and Dugan <em>knew</em> that, but he couldn't exactly tell Spidey that.</span>
</li><li> Marvel also has an instance of this with Valerie Cooper. In one instance, when Spider-Woman/Julia Carpenter broke Iron Man and the Avengers out of the Vault and helped them clear their names after they were set up and framed by Quicksilver, Val declared her a fugitive and outright told Iron Man that even if the Avengers <em>were</em> innocent from the start, it didn't give Julia the right to break the law either way.
</li></ul></li><li> The entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shazam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shazam">Marvel Family</a> was like this. In Marvel Family #46 this gets taken to a ridiculous extreme by Mary Marvel. When she and an explorer are on an island of robots, they find out a law by the long-vanished civilization says that any humans there must be executed. Mary says she has to submit, as she 'never breaks a law, even the ancient law of a vanished civilization'. It is especially ridiculous considering Mary Marvel told the robots about the law when translating a document.
</li><li> The first <em>Spider-Man/Batman</em> inter-company crossover had an example that straddled the line between this Trope and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>. A researcher from a government agency (which one, she didn't say) developed a surgical procedure involving a microchip implanted in the brain that would effectively "cure" the criminally insane by rendering a recipient docile and harmless. So to prove it works, she decides to use the Joker and Carnage as the first recipients. That's right, with <em>no</em> previous test subjects, she decides to "try it out" on what may be the most violent lunatic in the DC Universe <em>and</em> the Marvel Universe <em>at the same time</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredExpert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredExpert">(Ignoring advice from both Dr. Kafka and Dr. Arkham, at that.)</a> It's debatable who's stupider - her for thinking nothing will go wrong or whatever government official who gave this the greenlight - but something does go wrong, and you have to agree with Carnage for calling her an "arrogant idiot" when it does.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuperHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuperHeroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em> could fall into this in their early years. In one instance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a> was not accepted into the Legion despite passing her test with flying colours because she had been temporarily aged to an adult after accidental exposure to Red Kryptonite, and thus was barred from membership due to being over 18. Aside from the fact that the <em>aging was temporary</em>, the Legionnaires <em>knew</em> she was really only 15 years old but still disqualified her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicIDW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicIDW">My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic (IDW)</a></em>, Twilight Sparkle has sunk into it on occasion, as it was apparently the only way the writer could stop her princess-level magic from being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">Story-Breaker Power</a>. Thankfully this has yet to happen on the original show. An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> example of this would come in her refusing to use her magic to stop a herd of bulls from hurting her friends and harassing the town because they are legal citizens. It becomes <em>doubly</em> Lawful Stupid as she decides to arrests them simply because they destroyed property that the ponies made false documents stating that it is historic property.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DetectiveComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DetectiveComics">Detective Comics</a></em> two-parter "A Walk in the Park", part of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanNoMansLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanNoMansLand">Batman: No Man's Land</a></em> story arc, the mayor declares that Poison Ivy, who at that point is living more or less peacefully in Robinson Park, restoring it and caring for children who'd been orphaned during the earthquake, is an ecoterrorist and must be forcibly removed from the park, despite the fact that A) the park has gone unused for years before the earthquake and Ivy is the only one who feels any need to restore it, b) the kids are all orphans and would likely spend years being bounced around in foster care if removed from the park, and c) caring for the kids and the park is keeping Ivy out of trouble. Alas, it's an election year and the mayor really needs <em>something</em> to make him look tougher on crime.
</li><li> The Angelic Host in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Crimson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Crimson">Crimson</a></em> are seven archangels that run Heaven and exist to be as unhelpful and obstructive as possible to the main protagonist. In their first appearance, they appear on a Christmas day to execute any sinners regardless of the severity of their sins and try to execute <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Alex</a> for being a vampire and when it's pointed out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Lisseth</a> (who is also a vampire like him) will cause a catastrophe unless if he can stop it, they shrug it off saying it's not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities">priority right now</a>. Later on, they condemn a minor angel for killing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters">human who actually deserved it</a> because only the Host is allowed to pass judgment on humans. And finally when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lisseth sets her plan to unmake reality and realize that Alex was the chosen one all along, but rather than help him, they decide the prophecy must play its course, leave him to fight by himself and block his allies from attempting to intervene in the fight. This costs them dearly since Lisseth starts draining their powers and immortality for herself</span>.

When Harry angrily points out that a student was almost killed, McGonagall even insists "that's not the point".

McGonagall still insists he was in the wrong and that his punishment stands.

Tsukune takes the time to call him out on it.
</li><li> In Act IV chapter 16, Rason accuses the other angels as such, considering the fact that Hokuto is actively trying to resurrect Alucard and destroy the world, and they're not lifting a finger to stop him because, even if he is now a monster and regardless of how evil he is now, Hokuto was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan">born human</a> and thus, the angels' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKillMuggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKillMuggles">Thou Shalt Not Kill Muggles</a> rule still applies to him until he actually dies with sin.

<ul><li> Many of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PiersAnthony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PiersAnthony">Piers Anthony</a>'s heroes are Lawful Stupid. Doing the "honorable" thing is more important to them than stopping the villain. If they were tricked into giving their word of honor on something then they will keep their word, even if it means allowing the villain to commit evil acts.
<ul><li> This was subverted in the <em>Mode</em> series when the villain made a deal where he would let the heroes go free if they agreed not to stop him. When the leader of the heroes accepted, he blindly believed the hero, because he knew that honor meant everything to him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Honor meant absolutely nothing to the main character and her super-intelligent psionic horse, who went along with the plan, and then betrayed the villain the moment they were out of his realm.

</div></li><li> In the Author's Note to one of his books, Anthony defends his characters' Lawful Stupidity as being the right thing to do. In fact, the specific example he was defending was Grey Murphy's willingness to become the evil Com Pewter's servant (if he hadn't found a loophole in his contract), which was a particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> warped aesop since it wasn't even Grey who made the promise.

Failing to honor promises you didn't make is wrong, but brainwashing is fine? Er, okay...

But, that last one is achieved <em>only</em> if you can show him that he's wrong in a way that follows his ethics using sound reasoning; upon which, he'll back you to the hilt, regardless of what he personally thinks of you. Yet, however much you might think all this would shoot him in the foot, he proves that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">often got a valid point</a>, (which is, moreover, correct in some crucial way; even if it's also rather biased) and that he isn't blind as to the consequences of his choices and actions (he will even admit fault when he did, in fact, screw up according to his own judgment; but, never to that of others on simple say-so). He wages a war of succession, tearing the kingdom apart to be king (he knows this going in; but, he also knows that being a king means <em>having the duty to actually run the kingdom as well as you can manage to</em> — a lesson others all-too-conveniently forget in their various bids for the sheer power of the position)... even though he doesn't actually want to be the king. He's the rightful heir, so there no question in his mind: by law and duty, it has to be done. However, he has a very good grasp of other people's self-serving intentions and capabilities, so knows full well few follow him with any of the duties he cares about in mind: which generally serves to make him despise most of them, even while he'll acknowledge enemies who don't follow him, yet do follow their own principles and laws to the best of their abilities. All these outwardly hardline quirks make most political players write him off as merely a predictable, inflexible and impractical killjoy who is impossible to work with (re: "not corrupt enough to let things slide"). Which can undo them, if they buy into it too much — <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist">and he often plays to that</a>, both in the field and in court</em>. By the fifth book, he's still insisting on fighting the War of the Five Kings long after everyone else has stopped caring about it, yet is also one of the very few to have noticed what is going on beyond the Wall. Fighting the Others is <em>also</em> his duty, as he sees it. Yeah, it's complicated.
<ul><li> An interesting part of his backstory that illustrates him is one time when he and his army were surrounded and besieged and a smuggler helped them by sneaking in food. Stannis eventually broke the siege and paid the smuggler, as agreed, even very sincerely thanked him... and then he <em>cut off fingers on his hand</em> (although he allowed the smuggler to choose which hand to keep) <em>because</em> he committed the crime of smuggling (the fact that this <em><strong>saved Stannis' life</strong></em> notwithstanding at all). The smuggler still decided to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> to Stannis.
<ul><li> Which goes with his belief that "A good deed doesn't wash out the bad and a bad deed doesn't taint the good one". Punishment for smuggling? Normally, it would be cutting off the right hand. Punishment for smuggling him food to survive and a lifetime of smuggling before that event? Cutting the tops of smuggler's fingers on the left hand, personally. Then giving the smuggler a knighthood, an island to call his own (making him first a landed knight then a lord), with a forest he can hunt in (a huge thing in medieval times, because it is lord's right to hunt) and taking his youngest son as his page and cup-bearer as a reward.

He only hates people that break the rules in Hogwarts - which, given his hidebound and unbending view of school rules (and his tendency to tack anything he can think of onto the list of Forbidden Items), is every single student at Hogwarts. This is exemplified in Book 7 when he seemed more concerned about students breaking the curfews than the fact that the school is under Death Eater attack.
</li><li> Sir Cadogan, a living portrait of a knight in full plate armor, acted under code of chivalry, but is considered mental by the rest of castle. He bravely took the place of the Fat Lady after Sirius Black slashed her painting, and harassed students who couldn't remember his constantly changing passwords. However, Sir Cadogan gladly opened up to Sirius Black, the one person he was supposed to keep out, just because Sirius Black told him the right password.

A shortfall in the number of people at the Sea Farm - even though the people are all in the area, just not living in the immediate vicinity of the Sea Farm itself - could cause all trade to and from the Hive to be blocked, dooming one of the Hive's telepaths and probably killing millions of people.

Forester's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HoratioHornblower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HoratioHornblower">Horatio Hornblower</a> novels, Hornblower can save his ship only by lying to a French officer that Napoleon has recently died. To make the enemy believe him, Hornblower has to support the lie by taking an oath on his honor as an officer. He plans to resign his commission in disgrace at the next port because he has permanently dishonored himself. Fortunately for him, he finds out, by Jove, Napoleon really IS dead, so the lie was the truth all along. In Forester's defense, he conveys the standards of that culture so vividly that the reader can believe in Hornblower's scruples.

<ul><li> There are many ways to interpret Javert's suicide, including the exact opposite of the above. Javert holds such a rigid view of right and wrong and has such a deeply ingrained repugnance for everything he sees as "wrong", that his suicide could be seen as the ultimate acknowledgment of Jean Valjean's virtue. The problem is, if Valjean is in the right, then that means that the dogged, obsessive pursuit of him by Javert was and has always been wrong. I.E. Javert kills himself because he cannot accept that he IS the thing he has spent his entire life fighting — or because he <em>has</em> accepted this, and becomes his own righteous executioner.

Arguably; either he is Lawful Stupid, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">real master of PR</a>, or simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">awesome</a>. In one instance, his troops are marching through wheat fields when Cao orders the men not to trample the wheat or they will be beheaded. Doing so, he wins the peasants' affections, since the peasants would like to eventually eat. Unfortunately, Cao's horse bolts and tramples some of the wheat in a panic. The law <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections">technically doesn't apply to Cao Cao</a>. Accounts vary, but in one version Cao either goes to take his own life or orders himself executed. His men intervene and stop him, and Cao Cao instead cuts his hair in disgrace and shows it to the army.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera">Codex Alera</a></em> novels:
<ul><li> Secretary Pluvix, aide to Lord Gram of Calderon, refused to allow a close ally of Gram's in to see him when Bernard, the ally, is bringing word of an immediate attack on the valley. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gram is shot by an arrow, Pluvix declares it was Bernard, or at the least, he set things up to bring Gram out and be in view to be killed</span>, and so had Bernard and his companion locked up.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolfMan">Canim</a> are bound by a strict set of laws, known as the "codes" that they <em>must</em> follow. The Canim, being savvy as to just how much those with less integrity would be willing to abuse the law, established a specialist caste known as "hunters" - spies and assassins whose purpose is to allow their lords to follow the <em>spirit</em> of the codes when someone else abuses the <em>letter</em> of the codes - allowing them to avoid falling victim to being Lawful Stupid.

<ul><li> The Knights of the Cross are modern-day Paladins. They are God's chosen warriors and each has a holy sword. When doing God's work, they are invincible. One of the Knights, Michael Carpenter, has a strict code of ethics and honor. The subversion is he balances this with true compassion and pragmatism. He is the best example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> which never veers into Lawful Stupid territory.
<ul><li> He's also quite willing to adhere to the law <em>himself</em>, while letting others do the dirty work, as exemplified when Michael, Sanya, and Harry confront one of the Denarians, Cassius. Faced with two Knights and a wizard that he can't hope to defeat, Cassius "repents" and gives up his Blackened Denarius, which contains the Fallen Angel that the Knights fight against. Michael and Sanya immediately and without question accept Cassius's clearly false repentance and leave, while Cassius laughs at them for their naivety. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They wait outside and listen while Harry turns on the now-defenseless Cassius with a baseball bat, beating the guy to the point of crippling him for the remainder of his life, to get the information they need.</span> Michael points out that he's uncomfortable with what Harry did, but doesn't object more than that.
</li></ul></li><li> And Harry himself is the master of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>, which is a key survival trait when dealing with the Fae (though by their standards he's merely a somewhat-talented amateur).
</li><li> Harry's early impression of the Wardens is that they're always like this, although it's mostly the hard-nosed fanatic Morgan who gives him that impression. And he's biased since he was unjustly accused of being a Dark Wizard. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When Harry gets to know him <em>much</em> better in <em>Turn Coat</em>, he realizes that Morgan isn't fanatic, but rather solidly uncompromising, because a lifetime of hunting down warlocks and seeing <em>none of them</em> be redeemed (until Harry) means that he isn't willing to give them a chance to kill more people.</span>

While she never stops belittling his beliefs, he keeps giving her calm and rational arguments as to why selling her body may be a bad idea in the long run. At the end of the book, the paladin and his Warforged companion confront the employer who double-crossed them. The employer is unarmed, with no guards around, and happily turns his back on them, since he knows no paladin would ever kill a defenseless man in cold blood. The pair leave. As they exit the compound...
<div class="indent"><strong>Guard:</strong> Hey, didn't you have a big axe with you when you came in?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Warforged:</strong> I left it with your boss.
</div><ul><li> More of a subversion, which Eberron loves doing. The Paladin may not have done anything, but he did not stop his companion, either. Lawful Good in Eberron is a lot less of a hard and fast as a rule than most D&amp;D games and the campaign almost explicitly states that not being capable of ruthless pragmatism will get you killed in that world.
<ul><li> Eberron is a deliberate deconstruction of the whole D&amp;D alignment trope. The employer in this example was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a> if he expected a paladin to act in any particular way based simply on his class.

The butcher betrays his village to some minions in hopes of freedom for himself and his daughter, only to be betrayed and subsequently held hostage and tortured for several months. After Eragon "rescues" him, he decides to punish the man further by preventing him from ever seeing his daughter again. Ignoring that she is all he lives for and gave up everything for. It is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a>.

<ul><li> Carrot is like this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuardsGuards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuardsGuards">Guards! Guards!</a></em>. He arrests people for disobeying laws that haven't been enforced in centuries and tries to <em>arrest the Patrician</em>. His biggest mistake, however, probably comes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo">Jingo</a>,</em> where he gives Sergeant Detritus permission to enact the Riot Act, which gives the Watch the ability to use <em>lethal force on civilians</em>, something that Vimes notes would frighten even Vetinari. Fortunately, Detritus is a slow reader, and Vimes gets there in time to sort it out.
<ul><li> When normally Sergeant Colon is made Captain he goes through a bout of the same, although just clamping things (including buildings), rather than actually arresting. Colon is not the sharpest knife in the drawer.

Some of the Martian higher-ups argued that because of his youth and the fact that it wasn't his fault, he should be given a second chance at the ceremony, but this chucklehead argued that he <em>deserved the usual punishment</em> and, because of this, was widely regarded as a "hero" by other Martians.

When he and his companions arrive at the sorcerer's castle, they discover that the woman is actually in love with the sorcerer and doesn't have any interest in being "rescued." The main character takes her anyway, on the grounds that he <em>has</em> to honor the last request of a dying person. And once he's gotten her out of the sorcerer's clutches (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> getting himself killed in the process, but fortunately one of his companions chooses to then reveal that he too is a powerful sorcerer and brings him back to life</span> and taken her back to her relatives, he asks her if there are any requests she'd like from him.

Revenant points out that the Colonel uses the Law as a framework for his action, preventing him from having to think too clearly about his actions and whether or not they qualify as justice or oppression. He even tops the analysis off by pointing out that for all his claims of representing the sanctity of freedom and justice, had Constitution been active during World War II, he would have most likely been one of the people guarding the internment camps used.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kathryn Janeway of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> has occasionally been Lawful Stupid. Several times she has refused to take an opportunity to get the ship home because it would require going against the "values" of the Federation. This isn't always a bad thing, mind — the Federation was envisioned as a near-idealistic society so it would have some values worth keeping to — but it grated on some viewers after a while. And if she <em>had</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">the show would have been over</a>. Was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in an episode, where a holographic simulation shows the Maquis taking over <em>Voyager</em>, because of their frustration over Janeway's Lawful Stupid tendencies. In "Madame Captain's" defense, though, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause">Prime Directive</a> seemed to <em>require</em> this of Starfleet officers. There were times when Janeway's stupid insistence on following this or that rule was so obviously jeopardizing the lives of the crew that any sane and reasonable life-form would have knocked her out and taken over the ship. And then she'd suddenly decide to pull something underhanded in an attempt to get home, before going back to acting all high-and-mighty again, which made her look like the biggest hypocrite. No offense to Kate Mulgrew, the character was just badly written, with multiple writers adding to the problem.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> was not immune to this.
<ul><li> For example, Picard and Worf regard violating the Prime Directive (or using subterfuge to intervene without violating it, which was something Kirk did multiple times) as worse than letting a species go extinct when their planet is about to blow up. See "Homeward", the episode involving Worf's human adoptive brother. In that episode, the crew screws up and one of the aliens discovers he is being misled (Worf's brother beamed his people to the holodeck so that they wouldn't know they were being moved from one planet to another during the transition). His world shattered, the alien man commits suicide rather than face the horrifying decision of abandoning his people forever or living among them but never revealing the truth. YMMV as to whether potentially destroying a culture is preferable to letting the people go extinct.
</li><li> Also the episode "Pen Pals", where only at Data's strong insistence do they decide to trouble themselves to help another planet that's about to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">explode</a>.
</li><li> In the first season episode "Justice," the Enterprise visits <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">a planet of</a> Lawful Stupids. They're as friendly as can be, but Wesley gets sentenced to death <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual">for stepping on some flowers.</a>
</li><li> If you think about it, the whole point of the Prime Directive is recognizing that interfering can do more harm than good. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">But if a culture is already in the worst case scenario (extinction), it's hard to see how the Federation can make it worse</a>.
</li><li> The worse it got was during one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekInsurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekInsurrection">their movies</a>. Let's just say protecting the allegory of Native Americans and their way of life doesn't work if the captain took part in <em>two</em> Forced Relocations <em>and</em> said allegory was hogging radiation that could save lives... Comparison? There are around 600 Natives. The radiation could save <em>billions</em>.
</li><li> It happened again in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIntoDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIntoDarkness">second reboot film</a> when Kirk gets sanctioned, demoted, and yelled at because a stone-age alien culture was influenced and their "natural evolution altered" by the crew of the <em>Enterprise</em>. The reason this occurred was that Kirk had bothered to try and save that species from extinction due to a massive volcanic eruption.
</li><li> Zigzagged because Pike seemed less upset with the interference than the fact that Kirk put his ship and crew in danger and followed it up with a shoddy attempt at a cover-up. Notably, no other officer was demoted or court-martialed despite them all being part of the action.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> manages to one-up the above examples in "Dear Doctor", as they doom a whole sapient species to death by genetic defect, despite having already developed the cure. (They decide not to distribute it). They do this because Archer envisions that there will be some directive against it in the future. In other words, he is stupidly enforcing a law that <em>DOES NOT EXIST YET</em>. It also relies on Dr. Phlox saying that evolution "intends" for the species to go extinct and be replaced by the other species on the planet, which is not at all how science works.

He promptly gives the other man all of his and Randy's savings, leaving them destitute.

Crittendon also constantly bumbles around the camp scheming incredibly stupid escape plans because it's the duty of prisoners of war to escape, not knowing that these efforts occasionally almost draw the Germans' attention upon Hogan's team.
</li><li> Dwight Schrute of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office</a></em>.

<ul><li> Talbot eventually wises up to the point that when HYDRA pulls an attack pretending to be S.H.I.E.L.D. at the UN, he's the first to express doubts it was really them and thereafter quickly evolves into actively cooperating, unofficially, with Coulson.

He sits on the information for some time because, as he explains to Ray, "It's a moot point. He has a gun; we don't." When Ray reveals that he took his backup gun on board, Fraser nods approvingly and then says, "I will have to arrest you, of course, once we land."

</li><li> To be fair, Fraser is as hard on himself as anyone else. In <em>An Eye for an Eye,</em> (S01E13) Fraser encourages a neighborhood watch effort that ends with one member turning to vigilantism. He tells Lt. Welsh that he's taken the liberty of officially reprimanding himself. Welsh tells him to "put it in the file with the rest of them," indicating that (a) this is not the first or second time this has happened, and (b) Fraser reprimanded himself with the Chicago PD, not the RCMP. He has a file of self-inflicted reprimands <em>with an agency he does not work for, in a country he is not a citizen of.</em>
</li><li> In <em>Mountie on the Bounty</em> (S03E12-E13), Fraser <em>throws</em> a gun at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mook</a> because he is only licensed to carry a firearm in Canada.

OK. Wayward Pines is a Stepford-meets-Camazotz nightmare in which any deviation from prescribed norms, any attempt to escape, and any attempt to talk about the past, is punishable by death. Every house and every street is lined with cameras and recorders, and you can bet that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadowDictator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadowDictator">Shadow Dictator</a> is watching you. Such behaviour is Lawful Stupid on its face, because no human society could function under such constant duress. But there's more. You see, Wayward Pines is in fact the last human settlement on Earth; the rest of humanity has devolved into cannibalistic crazies. The guy who made this town knew this would happen and so forcibly abducted large numbers of people back in our time and kept them in cryonic suspension for 2000 years in the hopes of preserving a human population. When he revived them and told them of their situation, they were naturally not all that prepared for it, and promptly died. So, what did he do? Did he decide to perhaps gradually introduce his <em>victims</em> to the reality he had forced them into? Maybe try to instil a sense of hope and purpose? No. He decided to keep everyone in the dark and kill anyone who came close to finding out what was going on. Um, dude. These are the <em>last people left alive on Earth</em>, right? Exactly how many do you have in reserve?</span>

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a></em> describes the "lawful over good" approach as a characteristic of the entire plane of Arcadia (between LG and LN). It's the primary plane of influence of the Harmonium faction. That is until the Hardheads managed to <em><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">slip the whole layer into Mechanus</span></em>. And got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a>, including proxies of Arcadian gods who weren't too happy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that they had to re-create their domains</span>, surprise. <em>AD&amp;D Player's guide to the Planes</em>:
<div class="indent"><em>... the Harmonium believes that peace is a better end than war. [...] If it takes thumping heads to spread the truth, well, the Harmonium's ready to thump heads. Sure, there may not be peace right away, but every time the Harmonium gets rid of an enemy, the multiverse is that much closer to the universal harmony it was meant to have.</em>
</div></li><li> The Mercykiller faction also has slants of this. As their name implies, they're dedicated strictly to justice, without compassion, without compromise. Mercy is an evil that must be extinguished because it pollutes justice. This is what happens when, somehow, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> philosophy and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> one, both believing in the sanctity of justice and retribution, merge.
</li><li> The Modrons are an entire species of this, thanks to being the "elemental embodiments" of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral">Lawful Neutral</a> alignment. If something does not match up with their procedural assessment of the situation, then they won't react to it. In one of the first adventures of the Great Modron March campaign, the party has to try and help a town that is in the way of the Modrons. See, three centuries ago, the last March established strict routes and procedures to take so they wouldn't cause any damage. But since then, things have changed in the town. The Modrons won't listen to the town's leaders when they explain this and stick to their routes from three centuries ago. And if this means smashing through buildings, or killing anyone who can't get out of the way fast enough, so be it.
</li><li> In the 3.5 <em>Players Handbook II</em>, we have the Knight class. In an attempt to make the archetypal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Knight in Shining Armor</a>, they instead managed to make "Lawful Stupid: The Class". For example: Flanking an enemy will make you lose one of your Knight's Challenge (core ability of the class), and if your Knights Challenge ability is not available when you violate the code (for example, if you have exhausted your uses for the day), you take a 2 penalty on attack rolls and saves for the rest of that day. You also can't strike a flat-footed opponent. In fact, the class is written in such a strange way that several players have written guides and fixes to <em>stop</em> the Knight from being the epitome of Lawful Stupid. This is especially painful since the description of the Knight class says that it's supposed to be for people who want to play a Paladin-like character without the Paladin's overly-restrictive code of conduct.
</li><li> Somewhat averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Greyhawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Greyhawk">Greyhawk</a></em> campaign setting. The predominantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> followers of the god Heironeous in what became the kingdoms of Furyondy and Nyrond seceded from the Great Kingdom of Aerdy rather than be subject to the increasingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> nature of its government and favored god Hextor. That said, Lawful Stupid remains the favored alignment in the Theocracy of the Pale. This is to be expected from a country that follows Pholtus, the Lawful Neutral deity who's nickname is "The Blinding Light" and whose tenants teach that followers should always follow orders blindly. Throw on a huge helping of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> against non-humans (basically, anyone who's half-human, such as half-orcs and half-elves, are worthy only of being slaves and anyone who's not human at all like elves, dwarves, and halflings should be outright exterminated).
</li><li> Pholtus's rival, St. Cuthbert, oddly averts this. Though "uphold the law" is one of his core principles, St. Cuthbert is also a god of wisdom and common sense, and he disallows evil worshippers. He encourages worshippers to avoid harming anyone who doesn't deserve it and to think about consequences of order, and one of his core holy books is about solving problems through reason. (For instance, in the old "man stealing bread to feed his starving family" dilemma, the Cuthbertine solution would be to punish the man, but give him a light sentence.) Unfortunately, it seems many of his worshippers miss the point of this - he's quite popular among the Harmonians above.
<ul><li> For that matter, Cuthbert himself is portrayed as having a serious problem with being judgmental, self-righteous and opinionated, with his general attitude typically being portrayed as "I know best, so do what I say, or I'll thump you upside the head". His alignment has wavered between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral">Lawful Neutral</a> in multiple editions, mostly due to this trait. His faith also has something of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiIntellectualism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiIntellectualism">Anti-Intellectualism</a> streak, mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallPoppySyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallPoppySyndrome">Tall Poppy Syndrome</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuddWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuddWasRight">Ludd Was Right</a> — one of the Cuthbertine holy books is "Parables of the Wise Fool", in which an uneducated rural man shows up any number of educated cityfolk on topics of importance to rural life, simply because "he has more common sense".
</li></ul></li><li> The core rules try to avert this for Paladins. The <em>Player's Handbook</em> states clearly that when a paladin is faced with a dilemma between Law and Good, the paladin will choose good every time. In the first edition at least, the penalty for an intentional Chaotic act was losing your Paladin abilities until you atoned (by spell or quest) whereas the penalty for an intentional Evil act was permanent loss of Paladin status. In <em>Third</em> Edition, the penalty for committing an intentional Chaotic act was... technically nothing at all, if the act does not count as a gross violation of the Code of Conduct — excepting that, the only penalty for it was the risk that if you kept it up, you'd slip into Neutral Good (which would make you into an ex-Paladin). The penalty for committing an intentional Evil act was becoming an ex-Paladin, no alignment-change necessary.
</li><li> Inevitables, a clockwork race whose sole function of existence is to keep the multiverse running according to law, often show this:
<ul><li> <em>Elder Evils</em>, a book from the 3.5 edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>, features a <em>canonical</em> example of a Lawful Stupid inevitable in the form of Obligatum VII, a kolyarut (an inevitable who enforces contracts) who wants to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">free</a> an unstoppable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> named Pandorym. Is it because Obligatum is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a>? No, it's actually because the <strike>dumbasses</strike> wizards who imprisoned Pandorym in the first place broke a contract with said Abomination by imprisoning it. Oh, and that "VII" in Obligatum's name? He's the seventh inevitable in the Obligatum series. If the party saves the universe by destroying it, Mechanus will just send <em>another one</em>, because enforcing that contract is more important than their own divine existences.
</li><li> Other Inevitables cleave very close to this trope on occasion. There's even one Inevitable that will kill you for living too long, should you do so by unnatural or extreme means (such as becoming a lich or sacrificing many other lives for your own protection). Ironically, there's an Inevitable caste whose mission is to protect the existing divine pantheons — which means that Obligatum should be coming under fire from a member of this much stronger caste.
</li><li> In fact, that very variety of inevitable — called a varakhut — shows signs of this mentioned in the book where it is first described. One of their tasks is to protect the integrity of divinity by hunting down beings who are attempting to ascend to godhood. <em>However</em> should the attempt be successful, the Varakhuts will then defend the new god as part of the natural order, as they are also tasked with hunting down any being who attempts to kill a god. Clearly, sometimes Law, even beings of pure Law, are confusing.
</li><li> Not to beat a dead horse, but there's <em>another</em> type of Inevitable called a Quarut with <em>very</em> Lawful Stupid tendencies. They're in charge of protecting the integrity of space and time, usually against wizards with the power to alter reality with spells that grant wishes or time travel. Nothing wrong with that, right? Here's the problem: they do so by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">using the exact same time and space altering magic</a>, in effect causing them to break the very rules that they enforce.
</li></ul></li><li> Kelemvor Lyonsbane, the god of the dead in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em>. He's supposed to be a good guy and an improvement over his predecessor. And indeed, he does not go out murdering mortals for the pleasure of it; he instead sees to it that all pass in their time. But then there's this wall in his domain, called the Wall of the Faithless. Whomsoever dies without having worshiped a god (even just paying lip service, though they get their own punishment, as being False) has his soul merge with the wall, slowly and painfully destroying him until there's no mind or personality left. People who live in areas where there is no religion featuring gods to worship are bound to end up there — even if they have no other option. You can give money to the poor, make clothes for the orphans, be the nicest person around, and if you do not worship a god, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall">all in all, you're just another brick in the wall</a>. <br/><br/>In Kelemvor's defense, he originally did try to tear down the Wall of the Faithless and instead instigated a program of rewarding every dead soul who passed to his realm for their behavior in life. This eventually led to hundreds of people forsaking their former worship of the gods and hurling themselves suicidally into danger simply because they now knew they could be assured of a reward for being good from Kelemvor. As Ao had recently altered the gods to depend upon worship for their powers and sustained existence, Kelemvor was unintentionally starving the entire pantheon of their power, and they united as one to force him to reinstate the Wall. The point here is the way <em>Forgotten Realms</em> is set up, there are no areas where there are no gods! Even if you somehow eradicated a whole bunch of gods, simply thanking "Lady Luck" would be enough to avoid this fate. To add to this there is an overbeing called Ao who would be responsible for creating/appointing gods to fill in this vacancy, or for letting existing gods move into the space. There <em>are</em>, however, areas where the only readily-available gods — which do their best to stamp out any competition — are not very palatable.
</li><li> Another Lawful Stupid moment from Kelemvor is present in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a> — Mask of The Betrayer</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He claims he can't deal with the spirit eater curse because it would be overriding another god (this appears to be a moral rather than physical issue), never mind that said god is more or less dead, but Kelemvor is said god's <em>successor</em></span>. He is refusing to do his own damn job. How does this guy get away with "neutral"?
</li><li> This is a negative stereotype commonly associated with Helm, God of Duty &amp; Obedience, Patron Deity of Watchmen and Guardsmen. A tendency to fall into this has been a particularly common accusation of both Helm and his faithful ever since the Time of Troubles, when Helm's response to Mystra's attempt to force her way back into the Planes was to kill her (arguably self-defence since she attacked him even after being warned not to, but their difference in power meant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">it wasn't a 'battle' by any metric</a>), further damaging the already-strained power of magic and creating the hitherto unknown phenomena of Dead Magic Zones and Wild Magic Zones. It got even worse when some of his worshipers traveled to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Maztica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Maztica">Maztica</a>, the Realms Mexico-analogue, where they proceeded to act like conquistadors.
</li><li> The <em>Paladin's Handbook</em> had many Lawful Stupid rules. For example, it's unthinkable for a paladin to retreat from battle unless his side is severely outmatched (at least outnumbered 2 to 1). Thus using such tactics (such as retreating to continue the fight on more advantageous terms, to trick the enemy side into committing some tactical error, or for whatever strategic reasons) are <em>clearly</em> against a Paladin's ethos. What to do if he's just <em>ordered to</em> disengage without an explanation? The same book also forbade Paladins from associating with evil characters, failing to realise that a) just because the guy is evil it doesn't mean that he can't serve good (by helping save the world for example); b) that the mere presence of a Paladin will limit how much evil the evil party member can do; c) that the presence of a paladin leading by example could perhaps lead said evildoer to abandon his evil ways and turn neutral or good. <em>The Paladin's Handbook</em> even suggested Paladins should avoid associating with a party mostly composed of neutral characters. The book insisted that Paladins could only stick around such groups for as long as absolutely necessary, and then that they should part ways ASAP.
</li><li> Fifth Edition has changed Paladins so they do not have to be traditionally lawful and can be outright evil with certain oaths. Each Paladin takes an Oath and are bound to follow its tenants, but these tenants range wildly from Oath of Ancient's oath to kindle the light of hope, to the Oath of Conquest's demand to crush all the hope of your enemies. The more traditional Oath of Crown demands you follow the law, it usually means you must follow and protect the laws of the monarch you swore the oath to, rather than every law of every nation you happen to be in. The only Oaths that have tactical combat implications are the Oath of Redemption, which has a tenant requiring that you use violence as a last resort, and the Oath of Conquest and the Oath of Vengence, both of which require that you be even more brutal to crush your enemies and make sure they <em>stay</em> crushed.
</li><li> A lot of Celestial beings fall under this trope. They are considered the opposite of demons from the hells. Demons are flat-out evil and selfish, merely doing things for their own gain, even if it means leaving a mountain of corpses behind them. Celestials on the other hand, are usually so Lawful Stupid that they can be just as destructive. In fact, it can be difficult to differentiate their self-proclaimed "Lawful Good" from "Chaotic Evil" at times. Even worse is that players in the middle of these conflicts tend to fall towards evil just protecting themselves from said beings. And that's not counting the number of Celestials who let their hatred for Demons get so strong that they turn to evil, becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngels">Fallen Angels</a> and joining the Lawful Evil devils to fight them. It's like they don't get that Devils winning the Blood War wouldn't be any less disastrous.
</li><li> One of the <em>stupidest</em> versions can be found with this lovely mechanic of the first edition <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Cavalier</a>. As a result of the code and the desire for battle, cavaliers cannot be controlled in battle situations. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">They will charge any enemy in sight</a>, with this order of preference:
<div class="indent">1. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">Powerful monsters (dragons, demons, giants) serving enemy leaders.</a> <br/>2. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightForTheCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightForTheCommander">Enemy leaders.</a> <br/>3. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Opponent cavaliers of great renown,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">and enemy flags and standards.</a> <br/>4. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AggressiveNegotiations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AggressiveNegotiations">Opponent cavalry of noble or elite status.</a> <br/>5.

</div></li><li> This trope is often specifically addressed in various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> religions, where it's spelled out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight">protecting the innocent and doing good is more important than upholding the letter of the law</a>.

Lampshaded in <em>The Prince of Lies</em>. The god of thieves, Mask, expresses surprise that Torm is willing to participate in a covert plot to undermine Cyric: "I always figured you for a storm-the-front-gates-in-broad-daylight sort of strategist!".
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em> setting, we have the Kingpriest of Istar, who sought to eradicate evil from the world. He started out by leading crusades against evil monsters, and eventually progressed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">having priests wandering the land using mind-reading spells and executing anybody who even had an evil thought</a>. Eventually, he sought to become a god, to finally fulfill his quest. The real gods dropped a giant meteor on Istar, destroying the city, killing thousands, and setting human civilization back 1,000 years, just to stop him.

<ul><li> Lord Mazdamundi of the Lizardmen, who has ruled that all species have to go back to within the boundaries set for them 20,000 years ago by a race who disappeared when Chaos first came to the Warhammer world. Part of this involves putting all of the elves back on Ulthuan — high elves, dark elves, and wood elves. The main downside to this? High elves hate dark elves, dark elves hate high elves, and wood elves hate everybody. The culture of the elves would be reduced to burning ruins within a year. Throw in the fact that Elves are manning many of the ex-Lizardmen anti-Chaos wards outside of Ulthuan... yeah, this makes standard Lawful Stupid look clever.
</li><li> This is a big part of the reason why the Dwarfs are dying out: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual">any slight on their honour, no matter how minor or unintentional on the part of the offender, must be repaid in blood.</a> They're nearly constantly taking losses in pointless wars against practically everyone.

</li><li> Why'd they start dying out in the first place? Because the Slann took a look at the state of the continents and noticed that a mountain range or two had drifted away from the place the Old Ones had put it in. So they put it back in place, never mind those short hairy guys living in the mountains. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">The destruction of the dwarf empire allowed the Chaos-worshipping Skaven to take over most of their territory.</a>

<ul><li> Many Chapters of Imperial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Space Marines</a> suffer from this. Some of them decry any form of stealth as cowardice; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">others refuse to retreat even when strategically or tactically viable out of a sense of martial pride</a>; and others still refuse to field <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">psykers</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">work alongside aliens, or even ally with anyone else</a> <em>at all</em> because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">deeply-held suspicions and prejudices</a> (although the no psykers is more an entirely justified case of not wanting to deal with a potential daemonic breakout during a battle). The Space Marines' holy book, the <em>Codex Astartes</em>, actually discourages this sort of behavior and contains all sorts of useful and varied tactical advice; however, adhering <em>too</em> closely to the <em>Codex Astartes</em> can cause a Chapter to enter Lawful Stupid territory from the other direction.
</li><li> The Ultramarines are probably the number one victim of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentuateTheNegative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentuateTheNegative">Accentuate the Negative</a> because of this. The Codex Astartes was not considered a document of holy significance in Guilliman's time. In fact, the Emperor specifically tried to promote atheism throughout the Imperium. Marneus Calgar came to the conclusion, upon reflection, that he was being Lawful Stupid and that Guilliman never intended for the Codex Astartes to be this way. So, in conclusion, in the grim darkness of the far future, there's always room for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>. At least until it was retconned in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">fifth edition Space Marine Codex</a>.
</li><li> The Monodominant faction of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">the Inquisition</a> are, as a group, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">fanatically devoted to the letter of Imperial law and dogma</a>, to the point that they are considered xenophobic and reactionary even by the xenophobic and reactionary standards of the Imperium. Monodominants fervently believe that only genetically pure and religiously faithful humans deserve to exist and that everything else - aliens, daemons, heretics, malcontents, traitors, and mutants, up to and sometimes including the psykers that <em>the Imperium needs in order to continue functioning</em> - needs to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">killed with fire</a>. Other Inquisitors tend to consider the Monodominants bombastic, closed-minded, and self-defeating, and note that their pogroms and witch hunts tend to bury more answers than they uncover (and, less importantly, tend to kill a lot of innocent people in the process). The Monodominants usually respond by loudly accusing their detractors of heresy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandVersusLeftHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandVersusLeftHand">attempting to kill them</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">(with fire)</a>.
</li><li> Ogryns are fiercely loyal beings who would never knowingly betray the Imperium or the God Emperor. However, they have the collective IQ of a doorknob and can be easily tricked into thinking anyone is betraying the God-Emperor by just pointing at someone and yelling traitor.
</li><li> Another great example of Lawful Stupid space marines comes from the later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Packs</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War 2: Chaos Rising</a></em> gives us a unique example of a Lawful Stupid Space Marine inside the Blood Ravens Chapter: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Honour Guard Captain Apollo Diomedes. Although he is pure, he is singularly bent on obeying Chapter Master Kyras (who is corrupted by Chaos). He transmits and defends Kyras' order to stop defending Blood Raven recruiting worlds against the Black Legion incursion. He then goes on to label Gabriel Angelos and the player as 'renegades' of the chapter when they don't stop. (Un)fortunately, his Lawful stupidity does not come without consequences in two of the three possible outcomes for him: the two bad endings have him either (a) die to Heavy Bolter fire from Avitus or (b) become corrupted by Apothecary Gaelan. If the player completes the relevant mission's sidequest and frees Apothecary Gaelan from demonic possession, Apothecary Gaelan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> this by saying "[Captain Apollo's] pride blinds him."</span>

In his eyes, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leandros</span> has failed this test.
</li><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts">Gaunt's Ghosts</a></em> novel, an officer is arrested for insubordination because he had been ordered to advance along a certain road and engage the enemy and was forced to detour around a traffic obstacle (While still obeying the important part of the orders - to engage the enemy). Gaunt recognizes the sheer idiocy of this and does everything he can to get the charges dropped.

Because of how prominent cheating is in the game and the natures of most teams, they tend to not win very often at all. Blood Bowl is, after all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem">a game in which even the ones who make the rules cheat</a>, and death is extremely common among its players, so sticking to the rules is <em>suicidal</em>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/JesusChristSuperstar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/JesusChristSuperstar">Jesus Christ Superstar</a></em>, Pontius Pilate is depicted in this sense. The powers that be, as well as the angry mob, demand that Jesus be crucified. Pilate recognizes that he sees somebody who hasn't actually committed a crime. He is, however, duty-bound to follow Roman law and the edict of his superiors. That's why he gave Jesus every opportunity to confess to <em>anything</em>; both to spare Jesus from martyrdom, and to spare <em>himself</em> from condemning an innocent man. Ironically, he could've theoretically delayed the inevitable as much as he needed, but Jesus's desire to die for the sins of humanity finally wore Pilate down, and he "washed his hands" of what would happen from there, while still viewing Jesus as innocent.
</li><li> Inspector Javert, from the musical (and yes, the book as well) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LesMiserables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LesMiserables">Les Misérables</a></em>, is rapidly approaching the embodiment of Lawful Stupid by story's end. Once a criminal, always a criminal is his mantra. He attempts to arrest the highly successful and well-loved mayor of a town who was running a factory explicitly for people who couldn't afford to live otherwise (all-around hero Jean Valjean) for the heinous crime of a parole violation years previous. He also attempts to arrest Valjean (whom he knows is superhumanly strong and a criminal facing decades of hard labour) armed only with a baton. Unsurprisingly, Valjean (who can pick up a fully-loaded cart) over-powers Javert and escapes. This wasn't due necessarily to Javert's stupidity (he's generally an intelligent man), but to his belief that "good" always overcomes "evil", where "good" and "evil" are equal to "law" and "crime", respectively.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThePiratesOfPenzance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThePiratesOfPenzance">The Pirates of Penzance</a></em>:
<ul><li> The titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pirate">pirates</a> are so extraordinarily Lawful Stupid that they're barely even pirates by the time of the play. While they have no problem kidnapping young ladies they feel the need to marry them before any ravishing takes place. They refuse to attack forces weaker than them because it's dishonorable. Plus the startling number of "orphans" they run into (as it's well known that they will <em>never</em> harm an orphan). In fact, at the end of the play, they stand down from battling with the Major General's men after being ordered to yield in the name of Queen Victoria, and "for all our faults, we love our Queen."
</li><li> Frederick is the embodiment of Lawful Stupid, as the subtitle "The Slave of Duty" indicates. He rejoins the pirates and betrays the Major-General and Mabel to them, just because of a technicality in a contract that was signed on his behalf when he was a small child. Especially when you consider the fact that the contract was arranged by accident in the first place. His hearing-impaired nursemaid was supposed to apprentice him to be a <em>pilot</em>, not a <em>pirate</em>.
</li><li> General Stanley isn't immune either, being so wracked with guilt it leaves him sleepless after telling the Pirates he's an orphan — sure, doing so easily saved his family without bloodshed and made him an entire crew of pirates as allies, but it was a LIE! Going one further, he states that it's a lie because of the family portraits over the fireplace. <em><strong>They aren't even HIS family.</strong></em>
</li></ul></li><li> The Duke of York from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RichardII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RichardII">Richard II</a></em> is determined to obey the law of the land above all else, no matter his own feelings or convictions. He refuses to support his nephew Henry Bolingbroke's bid for the throne (since that would be supporting an act of treason), but once Bolingbroke is crowned he will do anything to support him—to the point of reporting his own son to the king for planning a conspiracy. He even goes so far as to beg Bolingbroke to put the boy to death, and is revolted when the king considers mercy! York's whole arc serves as a pretty damning indictment of anyone who thinks that they can be a good or noble person simply by following the rules, without giving any thought to the (im)morality behind them.

If you accept his offer to visit his home, you'll find that his wife has been cheating on him out of loneliness and concern for their children, as Keldorn is always off crusading. The most obvious thing to do is to let him follow the "lawful" path and report his wife's infidelity to the authorities, which results in her permanent incarceration, the execution of her lover, and his two daughters hating him forever. Keldorn himself is more than happy enough to take a "good" alternative that involves talking with the lover (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">who willingly steps down if Keldorn faces him</a>) and reconciling with his family — although this causes him to temporarily leave the party.

Beatrix helps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> destroy two cities simply because the evil nutcase <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">Queen Brahne</a> ordered it. Steiner wants to return the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousPrincess">Rebellious Princess</a> who wants to escape said evil nutcase, and not only doesn't notice that the Queen has become an evil nutcase, he stubbornly attempts to return Garnet to Alexandria even though Garnet says repeatedly that she intended to leave and cooperated fully with her "kidnappers."

It's only after the Queen attempts to kill her own daughter that both of them finally admit that the Queen has gone off the deep end. When interviewed by EGM, the game designers all but referred to Steiner using the trope name: "When the knights come after him, he's certain that it's a mistake, a miscommunication. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyMasterRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyMasterRightOrWrong">The Queen cannot be doing this.</a>"
<ul><li> That said, Steiner does believe that Brahne would never do anything as drastic as start a war on the Burmecians despite the fact that the party comes across evidence of just that. Considering that Steiner served Alexandria long enough to become captain of the Knights of Pluto (and thus knew Brahne long before she began to go insane), Steiner's denial makes sense up until the dying Burmecian soldier appears in Lindblum - shortly before he has his own doubts about the queen.

In his defense, though, Vhailor is a member of the Mercykiller faction, a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knights Templar</a> who are designed to carry the Lawful Stupid mindset to its logical extreme.
<ul><li> He's considered extreme by the average Mercykiller's standards. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">And they lean pretty close to this trope by default</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> introduces the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorMonk">Justicar</a> Samara, who is sometimes Lawful Stupid, but sometimes surprises the player by subverting the trope. On the way to recruiting her, the player hears a lot about the Justicar's Code and how it requires Justicars to act in Lawful Stupid fashion, and the police officers in the area are anxious to get her off their planet before her Code compels her to kill anyone who impedes her pursuit, up to and including police (since, according to the code, any law enforcement who is holding up her investigation is a dirty cop, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithUsOrAgainstUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithUsOrAgainstUs">whether or not they really are</a>). The subversion comes when the player sees Samara use loopholes in her Code to avoid being forced into stupid behavior. That being said, she is very blunt about the body-count she'll accept, acknowledging to Shepard that the Code is a black-and-white set of rules in a grey world, and makes it clear that she will shoot her way out of the police station if they hold her for more than a day; the Code allows her to submit to arrest, but if anybody tries to actually put her in a cell or restrain her, the Code tells her that she is obligated to kill that person. Furthermore, the Code itself contains a clause that allows a Justicar to swear allegiance to someone for the duration of that person's mission or quest, during which time that person's orders override the Code in order for the Justicar to be able to serve the greater good without oathbreaking. (The Code also says that if, during this period, the person to whom Samara swears allegiance orders her to do anything immoral, she'll do it but will have to kill the person after being released from service.)
<ul><li> In a similar vein, the asari themselves hold the Justicars in high regard and respect the questionable rigidness of their code; they're treated as heroes akin to knights in human history, so they're given a lot of leeway. However, most asari also realize how archaic the code is, and more importantly, they realize how other races wouldn't understand or respect the righteous code of the Justicars outside of asari culture. Samara's recruitment mission involves you helping a local asari detective get Samara out of Illium as fast as possible to a) prevent her from restraining Samara, thus forcing Samara to kill the detective, and b) reduce the risk of Samara causing a cross-species incident.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood">Paragon Shepard</a> is a big and very refreshing aversion of this trope. S/he respects the politics of the galaxy until they start to get in his/her way. If Udina locks down his/her ship s/he will participate in hijacking it in order to stop the galactic apocalypse among other examples. It's one reason why Paragon Shepard is just as badass as Renegade Shepard.
</li><li> In the third game, if Samara is alive <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">at the end of the Ardat-Yakshi temple quest she'll decide that her code compels her to kill her last daughter since there is no longer a temple for her to stay in and Ardat-Yakshi (asari <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">Vampires</a> that kill with sex) are not permitted to live anywhere else. However, she can't go through with this and will try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">kill herself</a> because she refuses to kill her only surviving daughter, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">and so killing herself first is the only way she can see which would allow Falere to live</a> unless Shepard steps in. In that case, however, both Shepard and her daughter Falere will convince her that Falere will remain on the planet her own free will, which Samara accepts.</span>

Reason? The knights and church couldn't be bothered to help him rescue Sarah from a vampire because they apparently find fighting heretics more important. Leon was then all "screw you all, I'll do it myself."
<ul><li> Leon was also dumb in that, while he was stripped of his title and weapons, he still very likely could have taken one as he left, but didn't since as he was no longer a knight, they were not his to use.

They'll attempt to arrest you, and will try to kill you if you refuse to comply. Think you've escaped? Not so fast...they've been known to literally track you halfway across the game world attempting to bring you to justice.

<ul><li> Finally averted for the first time in the series by the city guards. If your bounty is low enough, you can easily get away with simply a slap on the wrist for picking up something that happened to be owned by somebody else if you just pay off the relatively small bounty. In some cases, they won't even take you with them to the keep, and will simply let you go immediately after paying off your bounty and giving them your stolen goods, and they have a lot more forgiving attitude than the guards in previous games. Also, if your crime is minuscule enough, you can talk them into just letting you go your way with a simple "don't do it again". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections">And if you're with the Thieves' Guild or are a Thane in their town...</a>

After a certain point in the main quest, they'll <em>insist</em> that you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> kill Paarthurnaxx</span> for his crimes in the ancient Dragon War and stop helping you if you refuse to do so, on the basis that giving you their aid would violate their oaths as Blades. All this despite the Dragon War taking place thousands of years ago, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Paarthurnaxx</span> helping to win it for humanity, and living peacefully and giving them no trouble ever since. To say nothing of the fact that the Blades can't exactly afford to alienate allies given how they were almost wiped out by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">Thalmor</a> not too long ago...
</li><li> <em>Daggerfall</em> and <em>Skyrim</em> both have law enforcement stick arguably stupidly firmly to the law in another way — unlike the other games, where guards can try to (sometimes follow you to) arrest you for a crime done halfway across the game world, those games have crimes be <em>strictly</em> regional — which means the guards and the law don't care <em>at all</em> how notorious you might be in a neighbouring region, not even when it comes to keeping an eye on you.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsOnline">Online</a></em> brings back the "universal bounty" system, which is really amazing as the game takes place during a time where there is no universal ruler of Tamriel, and you can be accosted in (for example) an Aldmeri Dominion city for a crime you committed in an Ebonheart Pact City.

As the Zerg were overrunning the Protoss homeworld of Aiur, Aldaris was more concerned about arresting Tassadar (the one person who was capable of killing the cerebrates and the <strong>Overmind</strong>) and executing him for associating with the Dark Templar, rather than about fighting the Zerg invasion. Tassadar even calls him out on it.

He sentences Tirion Fordring to exile for disobeying orders to try to save Eitrigg the orc from being executed for merely being an orc, and claims that Tirion's decision was motivated by pride even when he is forced to give up everything as a result. Uther is able to get past his belief that all orders must be obeyed at Stratholme but remains racist against the orcs.

Unfortunately, Chagall is a patricide who, when Eldigan questions his plans to attack the neighboring country, locks Eldigan in the dungeon and sends another lord to attack his lands and sister Lachesis. Rather than turn on him after Sigurd rescues both of them, Eldigan protects Chagall and continues to obey his orders when Chagall gets belligerent <em>again</em>, even going so far as to attack Sigurd's army. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His obedience to Chagall eventually kills him, either at Sigurd's hands or by Chagall's orders if he listens to his sister and quits his attack.</span>

Checking the status of your police departments while they're over-funded will show that there are actually more arrests made in their precincts than they are crimes committed, meaning they're wasting money arresting people who haven't even done anything.

They have a very lawful ethos, but the actual justice system is fairly ridiculous and usually serves to punish the one dwarf most necessary for the survival of your fortress because some noble demanded you make something impossible and threw a tantrum when it wasn't made. They're also quite prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a>, doing things like dodging off of ledges, disregarding danger in favor of loot, building walls from the wrong side and trapping themselves, and other such moronic things.

This strip is a good example of the former. It does have elements of subverting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a> since the whole thing was largely to get the ogres into a compressed area, but it would have been a much better plan if she would have told the others what she was doing.
</li><li> Hinjo, and apparently most of the other paladins of the Sapphire Guard, are aversions, as they act normally, rationally, and without being condescending. They also don't like Miko, and she is sent on away missions so they don't have to deal with her ("often for months at a time"). Hinjo does have his moments of self-righteousness from time to time, but he's mostly a decent, rational, and practical man. Even more so with O-Chul, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">Memetic Badass</a> and all-around decent guy who the author has explained is an intentional foil to the aspects of this trope Miko embodies. Miko is a representation of how many people would play a paladin, O-Chul is a representation of how one <em>should</em> be played.

However, he subverts this by using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">technical truths</a> and when his comrades resist authority, they tend to get their asses handed to them.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, both Lord Shojo and Redcloak denounce Soon Kim's oath of non-interference and observation of the other four Gates and the persistence with which the Sapphire Guard adheres to this, like this. Seeing as how this genuinely does cripple their ability to keep the Gates safe from Xykon, they kind of have a point (although the drama that happened in Soon Kim's group stemming from the death of one of their own has hinted that there's much more complexity to the situation than this trope).
</li><li> The dwarven council holds a vote on how their demigod should vote on a matter that will affect their entire race.

The vampires use a legal tactic to ignore the motion, and while a few eyebrows are raised, most of the undominated dwarves consider it an entirely reasonable compromise.

And get it in a headlock. And while Fumbles starts off with the idea that he can do it without involving the rest of his team, the comic is very good about showing that his actions have long-lasting consequences, and affect everyone he cares about, in large part because they also care about <em>him</em>.
</li><li> Big Ears the paladin manages to avert this nicely, which is rare for a paladin, as they are usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">flanderized</a> into one of these if they don't start out as one. He instead follows closely what a lawful good paladin should be.
</li><li> Which is horribly contrasted by Kore, a dwarven paladin who somehow retains all his paladin powers (including immunity to injury by the artifact axe Big Ears acquires) killing everyone he comes across for no other reason than being "tainted" by contact with evil and has no problems cutting down children and crippled, blind goblins incapable of harming anyone. Kore is lampshaded as something VERY...

<ul><li> Florence is a Bowman's Wolf, a genetically engineered life form (or "Biological AI") based on the Red Wolf, and so comes with a potent cocktail of genetic programming that can mess with her normally law-abiding, honest, ethical nature and reduce her to just a puppet if she is given a direct order by certain people in positions of authority.

Florence actually has to trick him into saving his own life because he's so Lawful Stupid that he refuses to let the fact that a hurricane is tearing the building apart around him prevent him from holding a pointless meeting (the only ones attending being himself and two robots who want to throttle him, but who are prevented from doing so by the Aasimov Laws). He's <a class="urllink" href="http://freefall.purrsia.com/ff400/fv00328.htm">not only offended to hear that Sam won't abandon Florence to die to ensure he gets there on time<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, he then goes on to <a class="urllink" href="http://freefall.purrsia.com/ff400/fv00329.htm">fake a heart attack<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://freefall.purrsia.com/ff400/fv00330.htm">in order to force the robots to hijack Sam's ship<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to be sure that he gets his way.

Formerly cunning and only minorly interested in the formalities of rank and nobility, he becomes convinced that the Titans (gods) are punishing him for not taking those concepts more seriously.

For instance, he actually <em>helped</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman">Blackarachnia</a> open up a tunnel <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">leading to the in-stasis Autobots from the original cartoon</span>.

The Eye magnified his power to truly awesome levels — but also magnified his <em>nature</em>, that of a protector and guardian, to the point where he was willing to deceive his charges by pretending there was danger when there wasn't, to ensure they stayed somewhere safe rather than moving on, even if they would spend the rest of their lives sitting in an ice cave.
</li><li> In a different sense, Alien X from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce">Ben 10: Alien Force</a></em> — a being capable of warping time and space, but whose thought pattern has been (and in some ways still is) strangled with debate between two diametrically opposed entities to the point at which the being cannot even move until a decision can be reached. Until Ben came along, they had no tiebreaker. And they're not very good at listening to him.
</li><li> Omi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown">Xiaolin Showdown</a></em> is Lawful Stupid in regards to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord">promises</a>. At one point, Omi has to team up with one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a> to stop a race of unstoppable spiders. They do this by combining two Mac Guffins that work together to give infinite knowledge to find a way to stop them. Before doing so, the Big Bad makes him promise to only look for the way to stop them and specifically not to look for "the way to destroy evil forever". In the end, he mentions he "peeked". In later episodes, the main group finds themselves in a desperate situation and begin telling him they want him to use the secret. He holds firm that he cannot because it would go against his honor as a monk even when all 3 of them think it would be better to do it anyway but he still refuses. The end result is as part of the Big Bad's plan, this divides him from his friends and causes him to go against their safer wishes of not listening to the villain. He ends up temporarily locked in an aggressive mood from this and pledges his allegiance to the villain. Once he returns to normal, he stays with the villain because he made that promise (ignoring his friends' cries of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHimself">he wasn't himself</a>").

</li><li> The Guild of Calamitous Intent's byzantine ruleset for "arching" constitutes a subversion; the fact that the rules limit the ability of villains to cause real damage is intended by the Sovereign, who understands that turning dozens of megalomaniacs with lasers loose on the world wouldn't be good for <em>anyone</em>.

While it's understandable that she wants the Avengers to work for S.H.I.E.L.D., she tends to spend more time antagonizing them than actual villains. The worst case of this was when she tries to force the Avengers to join S.H.I.E.L.D or be arrested... outright ignoring the massive war that is happening between HYDRA and A.I.M in the middle of New York, until given the proverbial smack upside the head by Iron Man for being an idiot.

When all of the student's cell phones ring unexpectedly, the faculty assume the students all have someone calling them at the exact same time and confiscate the phones while lecturing them about having cell phones on in class, not even thinking such circumstances to be suspicious nor bothering to investigate the cause.

The village made him follow EVERY law and tradition on the matter, using logic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">that would make trolls blush</a>. Even when the old Avatar appeared before them and explained A. he fell off a cliff when she split off her village from the mainland and B. The man she "murdered" was a conquest thirsty tyrant, they took this as a confession (though, to be fair, said previous Avatar also considers herself responsible for his death). The only reason they didn't execute Aang <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">was because he played by their own game</a> — waiting to be executed while Fire Nation soldiers wrecked the town, leading to the judge changing the sentence:

A demonstrative example is in the episode where Snidely Whiplash captures Nell from her wedding to Dudley. She manages to send a letter to Dudley asking for help, but he flat-out refuses to open it because there's no stamp on the envelope.

Later episodes tone them down, though they still retain a very black and white approach.

Fred, in a perfect example of going from one extreme to the other, has become obsessed with the rules to the point of refusing to let a cleaning crew in early and <em>interfering with the rescue because International Rescue are prioritising human life over waiting for clearance</em>. Ironically, in his rule-following zealotry, he's actually forgotten about an incredibly important <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleZero">Rule Zero</a> that <em>renders all other rules null and void during a potentially fatal emergency</em>, and he ends up being fired for causing and mishandling such an emergency.
