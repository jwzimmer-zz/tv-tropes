Yeah, pretty much this trope in a nutshell.
</p><p>Some kids can get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTakeAndNoGive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTakeAndNoGive">whatever they want by screaming at their parents</a> until they give in. "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGiftRequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGiftRequest">I want a pony</a>" is one common demand of these types, as is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyFoodDemand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyFoodDemand">any rude demand for food</a>. These kids do not like being told "no", or any other words to the effect of denying them what they want, and will often fly into a tantrum if so denied.
</p><p>Usually, but not always, female  and may grow up to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Rich Bitch</a>. Indeed, the grown-up version may still be referred to as a spoiled brat if they still rely on their parents' money and influence. Never <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceToTheWaiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceToTheWaiter">Nice to the Waiter</a> and prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">Never My Fault</a>.
</p><p>While the parents are usually depicted as the fault of their child's behaviour, it's not <em>always</em> their fault. As the brat is usually spoiled by enablement and a lack of consequences for their actions. It can be anyone; a cowardly teacher who lacks discipline, a naive authority figure, or someone that had put the brat on a pedestal and just never said "no" to them. They can be spoiled by the media when it gives them too much attention and praise, causing the child to believe they can do no wrong and nobody can stop them if they get out of hand.

(To be fair, if the parents put their collective foot down, the child would have to change.) Removing them to more natural circumstances may cure them entirely, unlike adults of similar personality. Many a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalNanny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalNanny">Magical Nanny</a> specializes in it. This is especially likely if the parents lavish the material goods on them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">in place of affection or attention</a>; any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a> may bring the child back to good manners by providing attention and discipline, and often wins the heart of the child that way, to the shock of parents, who may complain, "But we give him <em>everything</em>." The older the child is, the less likely this is to happen. In extreme cases, this may result in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTakeAndNoGive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTakeAndNoGive">All Take and No Give</a> relationship with their parents.

</p><p>A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperTrope">Super-Trope</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">Royal Brat</a> (where the brat is part of a powerful family).

</p><p>In older works the Brat may get their comeuppance in the form of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSpanking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSpanking">Comedic Spanking</a>  which as in the old saying is believed to be the opposite of "spoil the child"  but this is subject to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> these days as corporal punishment for children is considered less acceptable. Either way, if there's any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, it will probably involve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty">Break the Haughty</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrideBeforeAFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrideBeforeAFall">Pride Before a Fall</a>.

<ul><li> Generally, ads encourage Spoiled Brat behavior because the goal is to make children nag their parents to buy their products.
</li><li> The Toyota Highlander commercials circa 2008 featuring the little blond kid. He talks about how his parents used to be lame before they got the "cool" Highlander. The way he brags about it and the way he looks down on the kid whose parents drive an older car really give off the Spoiled Brat vibe.

</li><li> A Fruit Roll Ups Ad has it to where a kid says "Pleasssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss" throughout the entire commercial for his mother to get him a snack. So she gets him a snack.
</li><li> Recently, commercials for Halos oranges, a brand of oranges specifically marketed toward kids. The tagline is "If you don't have Halos, they don't have halos.", and one even features a little girl who <em>duct taped her baby brother to a door.</em>
</li><li> In <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRO2j8Fu6QY">this commercial,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a bratty little girl complains to her mother over fish that is an appropriate size for kids her age to eat. Unfortunately, the mother makes her happy rather than punish her for her ungratefulness.

They either get murdered or end up being the reason why someone was murdered in the first place.
<ul><li> Sonoko is a milder version. Sure, she's a Spoiled Brat quite often, but she's not outwards malicious and cares genuinely for Ran (therefore, she thinks Shinichi's not good enough for her). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongDistanceRelationship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongDistanceRelationship">Long-Distance Relationship</a> with Makoto is quite cute.</span>

</li><li> Frieza hides it much better than most, but it's there. He practically had a temper tantrum when he learns that he couldn't use the Dragon Balls without a help of a Namekian, who he had all but killed at this point, and when Vegeta tricked him earlier and stole his Dragon Balls, he was close to stomping his feet and threw random energy waves across the planet. His spoiled nature really comes to light when he's outmatched against Super Saiyan Goku, where he name calls, spouts words of hatred, demeans, and even begs for his life after his own foolishness cost him an arm and both of his legs. Throughout his entire life, Frieza thought he was the strongest and everyone should do what he wanted. When he finally met someone stronger than him, he was revealed as the spoiled child that he was. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie">Non-Serial Movie</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZCoolersRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZCoolersRevenge">Cooler's Revenge</a></em>, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongerSibling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongerSibling">older brother</a> Cooler outright describes Frieza as a "little brat" who King Cold spoiled rotten.
</li><li> Barry Khan from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> is depicted as such. He expects to be given anything and everything he wants, and when he doesn't get it, he throws a fit. It's so bad that when Videl rejects his flirting, he first attempts to set Gohan up to be injured in a stunt for his movie, and then tries to trick Videl into thinking Gohan is cheating on her, to no avail. Videl even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">calls him out on it</a>, remarking that despite being treated like royalty, Barry is so insecure that he'll resort to trickery and blackmail whenever he's not the center of attention.

The Ninth <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> thought of him as his own son, and gave him love and affection</span> — Xanxus, unfortunately, turned into a violent, ill-tempered Spoiled Brat who wasn't used to things not going his way. His being a Spoiled Brat is especially noticeable when one considers that, although being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> to Tsuna, he actually had much less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">abuse</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">neglect</a> in his past.
<ul><li> Even ten years into the future, as much as he's thought to be less of a douchebag than before, he's still ridiculously spoiled and rotten tempered. Most notably the "beef incident" here, where he beat the crap out of a bunch of underlings because he <strong>wanted to eat beef</strong>, and it had to be the best quality, and it <strong>had</strong> to be filleted, and <strong>how do they expect him to eat this shit</strong>?!
</li><li> Hibari shows signs of being this, as well. Anything he wants, he <em>gets</em>. Or heads will roll.

And just look at his reaction to when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Mukuro</a> beat him in a fight - he becomes obsessed with completely annihilating him, since he absolutely <em>hates</em> the idea of ever losing to someone. The only thing about Hibari, however, is that he really <em>does</em> have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">the strength and genius to justify his haughty, spoilt, stuffy attitude</a>.

She does end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">learning to leave it behind</a>, although she's still very insistent on having her opinions be heard.

He whines about Char getting all the glory and pesters his more prominent family members into giving him a combat posting so he can earn some fame for himself... <strong>after</strong> complaining about looking like the "baby" of the Zabi family. It should be noted, however, that this is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation">Alternate Character Interpretation</a> that clashes with Garma's canon personality from the original anime.
<ul><li> Garma being a Spoiled Brat is actually Char's view on him that has existed since the original anime. There's this piece of words he uttered during Garma's funeral:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Gihren</strong>: Why did my brother, Garma, has to die?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Char</strong>: (watching the broadcast, while Gihren continues his speech) Because he was a Spoiled Brat.
</div><ul><li> Bright Noa calls Amuro Ray this when slapping him because his father never punched him... Yeah, it doesn't make much sense but he probably meant the fact that he was never corrected for showing a whiny behaviour.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> The World Nobles are basically what would happen if you gave a spoiled brat enough wealth and political power to be completely untouchable and able to do whatever they can. On top of being ridiculously rich, they are also spoiled to the point that they think everything belongs to them: and sadly, considering they are descended from the twenty kings who founded the World Government, few would disagree with them. Their attitude is supported by their ability to call in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">one of the Admirals</a> for any reason, meaning that anyone who refuses to take the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil">abuse they constantly dish out</a> gets a walking natural disaster sicced on them. It's because of this that that the only people considered capable of defying the World Nobles are the Four Emperors, the four most powerful pirates in the world — mainly because not even the Admirals stand a chance against one of <em>them</em>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Doflamingo</span> might be the worst of the lot. He grew up as a World Noble with all of the privileges that entailed, and didn't take it well at all when his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence">father</a> took their family away from that life to lives as commoners. Even after killing his own father and presenting his head to the World Nobles, they refused to reinstate his status because he was from a "family of traitors". All of his villainy is done out of petty resentment at the world for taking away the privileges he feels entitled to have, which you can more or less relate to him having a temper tantrum.

The doctor then tells Timmy's mother that "There's nothing wrong with your son that a good smack on the bottom wouldn't cure!".

<ul><li> The trope picture comes from a story where she tries to prove to Betty that she also works hard, by being "forced" to drive all of her family's expensive cars, do country club sports, and attend fancy parties. She even tries to imply that wearing a designer dress and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyInMink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyInMink">white fox wrap</a> to social events is part of this "work".
</li><li> In another story, she wants to get a job like all her friends have, but she's just not motivated enough to actually apply for one. In one comic chapter, everyone is busy with their summer jobs... except Veronica. She has no siblings (that we see, anyway), and her parents are busy running the family corporate empire, so she's pretty much alone and already bored with the empty days of summer vacation. She wished she had something to do, even a job, because this boredom is driving her crazy. Archie eventually comes by and visits, telling her about this one position open at the jewelry shop in the nearby mall. He says this position would be perfect for her, since she wears so much of it. Veronica looks like she's going to accept... then decides not to, because she's so wealthy she doesn't need to work. Apparently, having loads of money means one can never get an actual job, even if it's just to pass the time.

In his words, "Whatever a Diamond wants, they get." However, he hasn't really been shown as actually <em>wanting</em> that much, relatively  he loves Earth as it is, and his "end goal" when the story starts is to tour all of Earth before eventually exploring space.

She's insufferably spoilt for a 14-year-old, which is the result of having five "mothers" (a.k.a. servants) who go through the "motherly" motions for her.

Most notable when she and her brothers Toulouse and Berlioz are fighting to see who gets inside the door first in the beginning of the film.

</li><li> Sharpay Evans from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighSchoolMusical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighSchoolMusical">High School Musical</a></em> is self-centred, arrogant, and narcissistic.

</li><li> Steff McKee from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrettyInPink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrettyInPink">Pretty in Pink</a></em>, is a HUGE example of one. He brags about his money, throws destructive parties in his parents expensive house, and tells his best friend he'll stop hanging out with him, unless he stops liking a girl that's poorer than themselves. He also likes to spend money just because he can. He eventually gets told off by Blane, his best friend, at the end of the movie.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice">A Brother's Price</a></em>, Keifer Porter is at the very least 16 when he becomes plot-relevant, but still qualifies, as his behaviour is entirely described in spoiled-brat terms. He is said to have thrown temper tantrums whenever his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExoticExtendedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExoticExtendedMarriage">wives</a> didn't do what he wanted, or sometimes just out of spite <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> so he would have an excuse for locking himself up in his quarters and cheat on them with a lover he smuggled in through the secret passage</span>. As he was from a noble family, and men have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderRarityValue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderRarityValue">Gender Rarity Value</a> in this setting, he likely grew up as Spoiled Brat.
</li><li> Veruca Salt of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a></em>, along with the two movies based on it. In the book and the first movie, it's explicitly mentioned she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyInMink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyInMink">wearing a mink coat</a>. It's not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurAndLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurAndLoathing">Fur and Loathing</a> here; it's that mink coats were almost never made for girls at the time (mostly rabbit), no matter how wealthy the family. She has her parents wrapped pretty much completely around her finger, bowing to her every demand, but both she and they meet with an awful end when her insatiable greed leads her to try to steal one of the squirrels that Wonka uses to sort nuts for his candy.
<ul><li> Veruca's song, "I Want It Now!", from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WillyWonkaAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WillyWonkaAndTheChocolateFactory">1971 adaptation</a> is practically "Spoiled Brat: The Anthem".
</li><li> The stereotypical "pony" line is spoofed in the 2005 movie:
<div class="indent"><strong>Veruca</strong>: Daddy, I want <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhNoNotAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhNoNotAgain">another</a> pony.
</div></li><li> Although Veruca is the most glaring example in the book, the other children (except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Charlie</a>, of course) are spoiled brats in their own ways. Augustus Gloop is a glutton whose mother just won't stop feeding him, Mike Teavee is allowed to spend all of his time watching television and apparently subsists on TV dinners and Violet Beauregard goes unquestioned on any of her decisions by her parents.
</li></ul></li><li> A couple of examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dudley is EXTREMELY spoiled, though he gets better after the fifth book. Harry even wonders what Dudley saw when they were attacked by Dementors, creatures who force their victims to relive their worst memories. Harry, of course, heard the last words his parents said before they were killed, but can only guess what they showed someone spoiled by his parents his whole life. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that Dudley saw exactly that - they forced him to see just what kind of person he was.
</li><li> Draco Malfoy is a subversion in a way. Although he gets the best of everything it's often hinted that it's just another way for his father to show off his influence. Several scenes throughout the book show him getting very snippy when he thinks his son is acting... inelegantly. His parents also expect him to do very well in school (and for all his flaws, its made clear hes a very good student) as Lucius tells him <em>Chamber of Secrets </em> that hes upset with him for not being the top student of the class, even if its just because a muggleborn is.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBabySittersClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBabySittersClub">The Baby-Sitters Club</a></em>: Jenny Prezzioso; to many fans, Karen Brewer also qualifies.

She actively throws tantrums when she doesn't get her way, bullies Elsie every day, constantly steals Elsie's things even when she's not entitled to them just so she can have them herself, and always has her parents scold anyone who dares call her out on her behavior. In fact, she's so spoiled that she continues to act this way even as an adult, after marrying and having children of her own. It doesn't help that her parents are jackasses who condone her behavior because they themselves hate Elsie and her father, Horace.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSecretGarden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSecretGarden">The Secret Garden</a></em>, both Colin and Mary are this, at first.

Colin was neglected by his father and coddled and treated as an invalid by the servants because of his (possibly) crooked back.

<ul><li> Lemongrab of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> definitely counts. If he doesn't get what he wants (be it a reasonable or unreasonable demand), SOMEBODY is going in the dungeon. There are many reasons for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">sour</a> personality (mental illness, stupidity, immaturity), but he was raised in a castle in which everything was handed to him.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Roger is referred to as a spoiled brat a few times in one episode, and he and Stan tend to embody this trope whenever enabled, usually by Francine. Yet again, calling Roger a spoiled brat is basically an understatement considering the fact that he's over 1600 years old and a sociopath.
</li><li> Steve and Hayley, the actual kids of the family, have the odd bout of this as well, even if it's more out of defiance of their parents than being spoiled by them.
</li><li> Steve becomes an extreme example after Hayley elopes with Jeff Fischer. Stan and Francine both think the other's parenting methods drove Hayley away, so after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">bike race to decide how they raise Steve, which Francine wins</a>, Francine's extremely laid back parenting methods turn Steve into a fat, lethargic brat who practically lives on the couch. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He <em>still</em> turns out better than the clone of him Stan had made due to Stan's belief that his way of parenting is better. Stan's extremely strict parenting methods turn the Steve clone into a cat-killing psychopath who fakes running away and abducts the real Steve to take his place. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">moral</a> of the story is that Stan and Francine's parenting methods need to balance each other out.</span>

<ul><li> Despite this, Muffy is actually pretty nice and fits in well with Arthur and the gang.
</li><li> An Exaggerated and Enforced example of this is when her family is chosen to be on a reality show and the director, J3, wants to create drama to appeal to the viewers. He suggests that Muffy bully her beloved butler, Bailey, who she is very close with. This includes Muffy throwing food, badgering Bailey to drive faster, and a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MommieDearest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MommieDearest">Mommie Dearest</a></em>-inspired wire hanger scene.
</li></ul></li><li> Although D.W. Read comes from a modest middle-class household, she is sometimes prone to self-entitled, bratty behavior. One episode in particular which explores this is <em>More!</em>, in which D.W. tries to persuade her parents to give her more allowance after finding out her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledSweet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledSweet">Spoiled Sweet</a> friend Emily gets more than her.

Spoiled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> is more accurate. In one episode, he and his mother were shown eating nothing but rice for dinner, as though it was a regular occurrence. Maybe a nutritional deficiency is partly responsible for his behavior.
</li><li> A season two episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures">Jackie Chan Adventures</a></em> sees Jackie and Jade helping an incredibly rich <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">Manchild</a> search for a mythical lost city.

She has a horrible attitude, gets angry easily, is constantly begging her daddy for things, and hates being second in anything. In "Father's Day" we're actually given a backstory that Pizzazz started acting out when her mother abandoned her as a child. Her millionaire dad spoiled her with gifts instead of actual attention and this didn't help her situation.

When she does get one, she shoots the "normal" horse in the head with a gun.
</li><li> Stumpy may also count as one, although he's nowhere near as bad as Pretty. He demands all sorts of new toys, video games and comic books, and sometimes throws tantrums if he doesn't get what he wants.

However, given and hinted that Lipschitz is a "crackpot", Drew decides to not take his advice, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Angelica remains spoiled</a>. In later episodes, Angelica is not exactly as much of a spoiled brat as before, but her bossiness still hasn't changed much.
</li><li> Mitchell Peterson from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo">Ready Jet Go!</a></em> is a downplayed example. In "The Grandest Canyon", when he and his father look at the Propulsions' pictures of Valles Marineris, Mitchell whines that the hats that the group wore in the picture were not at the store that was at the canyon that the Petersons went to. Also, in "Mindy's Weather Report", Mitchell whines that the sandbags are too heavy, and his father spoils him by carrying his sandbag for him.
</li><li> Lisa Rental in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheepInTheBigCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheepInTheBigCity">Sheep in the Big City</a></em> is a bratty little girl obsessed with making Sheep her pet. When she doesn't get her way, she gets furious and whiny.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Male example: there's a bratty boy named Gavin who sometimes appears, bawling out his mother if she displays any reluctance to cater to his latest whim. He frequently refers to her by degoratory names such as "Stupid" on a casual basis as well. A particularly ironic scene when Bart is caught shoplifting a videogame his mother refused to buy him, as he's been taken away Gavin's mother shakes her head saying "The parents of that kid are really messing him up".
</li><li> Bart Simpson himself used to come off this way, if only by default because he was so disobedient and disrespectful but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">never seemed to get punished severely for these actions</a>. (His name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignificantAnagram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignificantAnagram">is an anagram for "brat",</a> after all.) One episode played this up by having Bart repeatedly play pranks and pull obnoxious stunts, leading his teacher to demand that Marge and Homer discipline him. Marge really did try, but her efforts were all futile because Homer constantly felt sorry for Bart and would undo Marge's punishments when she wasn't there.
</li><li> Harper Jambowski, a girl and one-shot character. Her fater Mike Jambowski, is extremely rich, which turned Harper into a selfish and spoiled kid. She didn't let Lisa participate in any of the activities they've done together, although it's shown that she can be good sometimes. She buys Lisa a new, expensive bike, but Lisa refuses it, making Harper upset, since Lisa would "rather have (her) crappy bike". They discuss this and decide to end their friendship.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst">Sofia the First</a></em>:
<ul><li> Princess Amber's first priority is often herself, and she's so used to getting what she wants that she'll perform a bad deed to get it only to regret it after seeing the trouble she caused, such as wishing her father was allergic to Sofia only to turn her sister into a cat...but her father doesn't punish her for it.
</li><li> Princess Hildegard proves in "Dads and Daughters Day" that she makes Amber look like an angel, as she kept telling her father that she wants an Enchanted Animal from the park. Even after her behavior got the dads and daughters chased and trapped by a herd of angry Pelicants, she still wants an Enchanted Animal. Her father even says that it's time for her to learn that she can't get everything she wants.
</li></ul></li><li> Eric Cartman of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>. Here's one of his milder examples:
<div class="indent"><strong>Cartman:</strong> Mom, can you get me some Weight Gain 4000? <br/><strong>Cartman's Mom:</strong> Okay Eric. I'll get you some at the store tomorrow. <br/><strong>Cartman:</strong> But mom, I need it for tomorrow! <br/><strong>Cartman's Mom:</strong> But, tomorrow is grocery day, Eric. <br/><strong>Cartman:</strong> <em>Mooooooom</em> (<em>whines incoherently</em>) <br/><strong>Cartman's Mom:</strong> Okay, okay. Well, I guess I'll be going to the store now, then. <br/><strong>Cartman:</strong> (<em>smiles</em>) Sweet.
</div></li><li> Pink Diamond from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> was this. Being the youngest of the Diamonds, she didn't have as much privileges as they did at first, and constantly demanded for her to be respected and to have her own colony. We even see Stevonnie portray her having a temper tantrum in "Jungle Moon". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It got to the point where Pink hated herself for this, and chose to retire her Pink Diamond persona and become Rose Quartz</span>.
</li><li> Wendy O. / Kootie Pie Koopa from the various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> cartoons is a huge example. One of her catchphrases is simply "I WANT IT! I WANT IT! I WANT IT!" (<a class="urllink" href="http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=X-FApni9YVM">See for yourself!<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) She once demanded, and was given, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShinyNewAustralia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShinyNewAustralia">Antarctica</a></em>, and then briefly demanded to be Empress of America.
</li><li> Daisy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a></em> is one of the (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge">presumably</a>) older examples of the trope. In her debut episode, she threw a tantrum over being assigned to pull a milk tanker, and gets away with it. However, by the CGI series, she eventually grows out of this persona.
</li><li> Montana Max from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></em> is a pretty blatant example. He's even referred to as one multiple times.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em> has had more then its fair share
<ul><li> Season 1 has Heather. You know it's bad when we see her parents actually <em>partying that she's gone</em>.
</li><li> <em>Total Drama Action</em> gave this to Courtney, who practically and blatantly rigs the contest in her favor, threatening to sue if she doesn't "get the win she deserves" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ironically she doesn't' because even her <em>lawyers</em> can't stand her whining</span>.
</li><li> <em>Total Drama Revenge of the Island</em> brought us fame magnet, Dakota, whose more interested in the publicity rather then winning the contest. Chris decides to knock her down a few pegs because of it.
</li><li> <em>Pahkitew Island</em> gave us Sugar. Though no where near rich, her obsession with being a "beauty pageant queen" pretty much screams this.
</li><li> The spinoff <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramaPresentsTheRidonculousRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramaPresentsTheRidonculousRace">Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race</a></em> gave us Taylor who is spoiled, entitled, rude and treats her mother like dirt.
</li></ul></li><li> Jeremy Creek in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTownSantaForgot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTownSantaForgot">The Town Santa Forgot</a></em>: He starts out spoiled until his parents stop buying him toys, he then gets the idea of writing a HUGE Christmas list to Santa but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">all the toys he wanted went to a town with his name, thus seeing the selfishness of his ways, he decides to reform, and therefore becomes generous</span>
