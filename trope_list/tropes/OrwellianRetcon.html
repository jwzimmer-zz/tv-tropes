<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar">Lucky Star</a></em> has a minor example: Konata was originally portrayed as a cool <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GamerChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GamerChick">Gamer Chick</a>, but was soon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">changed</a> into an down-to-earth, sort-of-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac">pervy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OtakuSurrogate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OtakuSurrogate">Otaku Surrogate</a>. When the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yonkoma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yonkoma">yonkoma</a> were collected into volumes, Yoshimizu changed Konata's lines in some very early strips to make her image consistent. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Because this change was very early on in the series</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Yoshimizu discussed that</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusMaterial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusMaterial">omake</a>, it is not as displeasing. Parodied in a later omake, which consists of several "What if"-strips. One of them is "What if episode 1 was drawn today", which is simply a reprint of the strip just as it was published in the first volume.
</li><li> The original dubbed airing of the Dungeon Dice Monsters mini-arc of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> anime used the original designs for the Dice Crests. For no adequately explained reason<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0uvh7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0uvh7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0uvh7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> but possibly for the same reason that the card images are altered for the dub</span>, all subsequent airings used CG dice with a completely changed set of Crest markings. Fortunately, the American board game version and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> adaptation used mostly the original designs, with only the Magic Crest changed to a circle with a lightning bolt in the center.
<ul><li> The original <em>Weekly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenJump">Shonen Jump</a></em> printing of a chapter in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> manga, of Yugi's duel with Bakura, had Bakura's trump card monster called "Dark <strong>Necrophilia</strong>". This was then changed to "Dark Necrofear" for the following chapter and the graphic novel reprints, to avoid the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> of the original name.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pokémon Adventures</a></em> gets a <em>lot</em> of changes and revisions when its chapters get collected into tankōbon form. Makes sense, as the manga gets serialized in three different magazines and out of order to boot, not to mention the mangaka often adds new details to incorporate whatever new features that had since been released from the new games.
</li><li> While the original design for the Pokémon Jynx has been a subject of controversy for years (see Video Games section below), The Pokémon Company International has taken action by pulling three episodes that feature Jynx in her original design in the same manner that The Pokémon Company in Japan pulled "Cyber Soldier Porygon", i.e. they pretend that these episodes never existed. What makes this worse in Jynx's case is that one of the episodes just features her in a <em>small cameo</em>, and that one of the pulled episodes was remastered in Japan so that Jynx would appear in her current design.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> A minor one in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VizMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VizMedia">Viz Media</a>'s English edition of the manga involves a particular character being called "Zoro" in early printings of the first few volumes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">later being changed to "Zolo"</a> to match <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids Entertainment</a>'s dub of the TV series. However, Zolo stuck for Viz even when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation">Funimation</a> later changed his name back to Zoro in their own dub.
</li><li> Done in reprints of the volumes to Whitebeard's flag as the Nazi swastika <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSwastikas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSwastikas">was off limits to use</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Japanese home video release of the 1986 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em> theatrical movie changed the ending of the final battle so that Kenshiro's final battle with Raoh ends in a stalemate rather than losing like in the original theatrical version. Even though the theatrical ending was used for all the international releases, it didn't get to be featured in any of the Japanese home video releases until the DVD release in 2008 and even then it was only available as a bonus feature in first-print editions of the DVD.
</li><li> Chapter 83 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> is never included in any re-releases <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">at the author's own request</a>, as he felt it revealed too much about the setting too soon and limited his ability to expand upon it later. To be fair, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it'd be hard to go anywhere after introducing the literal god of the <em>Berserk</em> world</span>.
</li><li> In the anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArtOfFighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArtOfFighting">Art of Fighting</a></em>, Yuri Sakazaki was originally voiced by a young, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetroactiveRecognition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetroactiveRecognition">not-yet-famous</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AyumiHamasaki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AyumiHamasaki">Ayumi Hamasaki</a>, who also appeared in a series of live-action promos for <em>Art of Fighting 2</em> in Japan. When the anime was re-released on DVD in Japan, all of Ayumi's dialogue were dubbed over by Kaori Horie, Yuri's actual voice actress in the games, since Hamasaki (who had become a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JPop">J-Pop</a> star in the intervening years) wanted a great share of the royalties for the use of her voice.
</li><li> Along with more standard panel redraws, a few instances occur in the 2003 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> manga, (published stateside by Kodansha in 2011), some of which carry over to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal">Sailor Moon Crystal</a>.</em>
<ul><li> During Act 2's Crystal Seminar story (which introduced Ami), an instance of a floppy disk from the original 1992 version was replaced by a CD-ROM in the re-released version. Also, to be consistant with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyGuardianSailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyGuardianSailorMoon">tokusatsu version</a> that was airing at the time, the "sailor senshi" are referred to as "guardians".
</li><li> An unnamed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfDoom">fog attack</a> in the manga (referred to as "Sabao Spray" in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">first anime</a>) was changed to be called "Mercury Aqua Mist", to tie in with the live-action version. Sailor Moon's first sceptre was also redrawn to have a crystalline top.
</li><li> Sailor Jupiter had a flower-themed belt added to her first uniform in redrawn panels, a detail that Takeuchi had originally wanted to include on her but had never gotten the chance to.
</li><li> The 2011 English-language editions from Kodansha USA underwent some minor revisions in reprints to correct some mistakes, including an instance of mistranslating Jupiter's "Sparkling Wide Pressure" as "Spark Ring Wide Pressure," and Queen Beryl referring to herself as "<em>Princess</em> Beryl."
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>, Near was introduced as a serious character, but had some childish expressions in certain early chapters. When these chapters were collected into the tankōbon editions, Takeshi Obata redrew the panels so Near's face would be less expressive.
<ul><li> Another example involved <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the death of Light's father</span>. In the original Jump serialization, Ryuk speculates that since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Soichiro never used a Death Note, he would go to Heaven</span>. As the final chapter of the manga ultimately revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">there is NO Heaven or Hell (at least, Ryuk doesn't think so), Ohba altered the line in the tankōbon release to prevent any further misunderstandings, with Ryuk now speculating that Mr. Yagami would have died peacefully</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> A necessary one happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/QueensBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/QueensBlade">Queen's Blade</a> Rebellion</em> between the web version of the Illustrated Stories and the paperback version: In the Net-based one, Mirim kills one of the Tomoe's fellow shrine maidens (later revealed to be named Tokiwa) when trying to help Annelotte escape from Gainos. Since that scene is out of character for her, in the paperback version, Tokiwa was killed by random guards instead, while Mirim is chasing Annelotte instead. This was omitted in the animated version, as the aforementioned scene never happens and the events are developed in a different direction. Also, the manga version has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leina using her "Maria" persona</span> rescuing Annelotte instead, rather than Tokiwa, and Mirim does not appear until some chapters later.
</li><li> The early print run of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Cyborg009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Cyborg009">Cyborg 009</a></em> in Weekly Shōnen King had the lead hero's name first given as "Joe Muramatsu", which later changed to "Joe Shimamura". Ishinomori would revise the earlier chapters when they were reprinted, to correct that continuity error. He also corrected a few instances where 003's surname was used in light of her given name, or where he'd used the wrong katakana for 003's given name and called her "Francois" instead of "Francoise".
<ul><li> The chapter "The Aurora Strategy" originally had a character named "Dr.Dolphin" and his daughter "Iruka". In some reprintings, Iruka's name was modified to "Cynthia", which the 2001 anime used.
</li></ul></li><li> One of these happened in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuruYuri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuruYuri">Yuru-Yuri</a></em>; early in the manga, Akane was originally Akari's (unnamed) older brother. He was converted into a girl for the anime, and this change persisted into later chapters.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StoneOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StoneOcean">Stone Ocean</a></em> was still running in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenJump">Shonen Jump</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the final evolution of Pucci</span>'s Stand was called <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin">Stairway to Heaven</a></span>. When it was collected in tankōbon, it was renamed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Made in Heaven</a></span>, possibly because the lyrics fit the motives of its user better. Fan translations are more likely to call it the latter.
<ul><li> In the same part, a stand with the name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EarthWindAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EarthWindAndFire">Earth, Wind &amp; Fire</a> had its name changed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PlanetWaves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PlanetWaves">Planet Waves</a> for the tankōbon release, due to the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable">Part 4</a> <em>already</em> had a stand using the same name, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation">maybe</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> When Son Gohan debuted in Chapter 196 in Weekly Shōnen Jump, he gave his age as <strong>three</strong> years old, hence why he holds up three fingers. Gohan is said to be four years old on the title page of the very next chapter, and his dialogue is altered in collected re-releases to change his age to four.
</li><li> Similarly, in the original version of Chapter 213, when Krillin meets up with Gohan to fight Nappa and Vegeta, their dialogue implies they are meeting for the first time. By the time the tankōbon came out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama">Akira Toriyama</a> apparently remembered that they had met at Kame House a year earlier, and their dialogue was rewritten accordingly.

Since the first 67 episodes weren't recorded until 2005, the remaining episodes (recorded from 1999-2003) had some inconsistencies, especially in the Ginyu/Frieza episodes, where over half of the characters had redubbed dialogue. Some characters (Vegeta, Krillin, Frieza) had the same actors giving much improved performances, while others (Ginyu, Burter, Tien) had been recast, and were now being redubbed by their replacement actors for consistency. Most of this redubbing stopped by the Android saga, though notably Maron, Spice, and Mustard were redubbed in the Garlic Jr. episodes by new actors. To hear the dub as it originally sounded, you'd need to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">track down the original DVD singles</a>.
<ul><li> They did something similar when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em> was released to Blu-ray, though it was only small changes, and far less noticeable ones.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a> Classic</em> was a reprint comic of the early adventures of the "All-New" team. Some of the reprints were edited to conform with more recent interpretations of the character. E.g., when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nightcrawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nightcrawler">Nightcrawler</a> was visiting Banshee's ancestral castle, his ability to (explicitly) turn invisible in darkness was edited so that he's merely very hard to see (i.e., you can no longer see the background through his body).

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a> special issue <em>Sonic Firsts</em> reprinted a few old stories, with Princess Sally recolored to look more like her modern design and all references to "Boomer" replaced with "Rotor" (whose name was changed early on to match the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM">animated series</a>).
<ul><li> All of the compilations also recolor Sonic's eyelids from tan to blue, along with various art improvements and continuity corrections.
</li><li> In the case of "Boomer", though, they actually do acknowledge it later on, by claiming that Boomer was a nickname he was given by his parents and Rotor is his real name (it becomes a minor plot point when Silver, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">who is from the future and thus reading about old events, realizes that references to Boomer stopped early and Rotor came in at the same time</a> — and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureImperfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureImperfect">mistaking that for meaning Rotor was a spy</a>.)

In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> #161, a story was printed where they go to a remote island and accidentally unleash an incurable centuries-old virus on themselves, explaining how they died. However, when the story was reprinted in Superboy #165, they were drawn significantly younger. This is because twenty issues prior, a story with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrumanShowPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrumanShowPlot">"Truman Show" Plot</a> was printed where the producer, concerned with his viewers not accepting an old couple with a teenage son, made the senior citizens of Smallville younger, Pa and Ma Kent among them.
</li><li> In the sixties, there was an attempt to establish a 30th century Superman, whose adventures were published in <em>Superman</em> #181, <em>Action Comics</em> #338-339, and <em>World's Finest Comics</em> #166. However, there was no effort to tie in the <em>Legion of Super-Heroes</em> series (which supposedly took place in the same time frame), so when his first three stories were reprinted, the setting was retconned into the 25th century.
</li><li> In "Superman Under the Red Sun" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ActionComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ActionComics">Action Comics</a></em> #300, when Superman manages to make it back to the Fortress of Solitude and finds a tiny rocket left from the enlarged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityInABottle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityInABottle">Kandor</a>, Superman gets some lead-wrapped Red Kryptonite with the intention to use it on himself, but a few panels later he ends up using a still functioning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkRay">Shrink Ray</a> instead. After using the rocket to return to the present, he goes on to say he'll wait until the Red Kryptonite's effect wears off, suggesting he had used the Red-K to shrink himself in the first place. Of course, when the story is reprinted more than a decade later, the panel depicting Superman shrinking himself with the shrink ray was changed so that he's using the Red Kryptonite instead.
</li></ul></li><li> The original print of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheNightGwenStacyDied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheNightGwenStacyDied">The Amazing Spider-Man #121</a></em> shows a "snap" sound effect when Spider-Man catches Gwen Stacy with his webbing while falling, implying that the sudden whiplash caused her neck to break, thus killing her. Reprints of the issue in trade collections omitted the "snap" effect, leaving the cause of her death ambiguous.
</li><li> Thanks to legal issues, all reprints and collected editions of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MarvelNOW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MarvelNOW">Marvel NOW!</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JonathanHickmansAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JonathanHickmansAvengers">Avengers</a></em> relaunch have changed Smasher's real name from "Izzy Dare" to "Izzy Kane."

</li><li> The original version of 2016's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CarolDanvers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CarolDanvers">Captain Marvel</a></em> #9 had a scene where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Magneto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Magneto">Magneto</a> and Carol confront each other. In it, Magneto implies that Carol is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">Jumping Off the Slippery Slope</a> with her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWarII">Change the Future initiative</a> and compares her to the Nazis, to which Carol dismissively compares him to an internet troll invoking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodwinsLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodwinsLaw">Godwin's Law</a>. This scene, along with Magneto's appearance, is cut from the trades, as Carol making fun of a Holocaust survivor and dismissing his experiences made her look bad.

</li><li> When Marvel began reprinting old horror and sci-fi tales in the 70s, they sometimes altered details to make the stories better fit the then-current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a> continuity. For instance, a reprint of a 60s <em>Strange Tales</em> story had a generic scientist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retconned</a> into being a young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan">Hank Pym</a>, while a reprint of a 50s <em>Menace</em> issue had a nondescript foreign spy changed to an agent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Hydra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Hydra">Hydra</a>.
<ul><li> The character Xemnu the Titan was originally called The Living Hulk<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">/The Hulk</a> in his first appearance. <em>Monsters on The Prowl</em> #11 changed most of these into "Living Titan/The Titan", the former of which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">doesn't make as much sense as the original</a> since a 'hulk' is supposed to be a dead ship, hence the main character calling the partially-mechanical Xemnu a "living hulk" after ressurecting him with electricity. Perhaps this is why he was never referred to as a Living Titan again.
</li></ul></li><li> A scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DirtyPair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DirtyPair">Dirty Pair</a>: Dangerous Acquaintances</em> involved Kei and Yuri <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggedForDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggedForDisguise">mugging a pair of hostesses</a> and stealing their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayboyBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayboyBunny">Playboy Bunny</a> uniforms to sneak aboard a luxury spaceliner. Due to possible copyright issues with <em>Playboy</em> magazine, the art was altered in the trade paperback to remove the ears and tails from the costumes.
</li><li> Some of the more recent releases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">Golden Age</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a> titles have been altered to remove content that would be deemed offensive today. For example, certain editions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1942" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1942">Vol 1</a> were edited to remove offensive caricatures of African-American and Japanese characters.
</li><li> The collected editions of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> volume got hit with a few of these due to inconsistencies with the new continuity:
<ul><li> All references to Tim Drake having been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/RobinSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/RobinSeries">Robin</a> were removed. Interestingly, DC left in the picture of him wearing his Robin outfit (it has an "R" as the logo, not the bird head logo that Red Robin uses - the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpisodeZeroTheBeginning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpisodeZeroTheBeginning">zero issue</a> would confirm that he wore that costume, but "always" called himself Red Robin).
</li><li> A cameo from Miss Martian (wearing her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcanon">costume</a>) was removed and replaced with an image of a generic, unnamed teen heroine.
</li><li> A line in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman">Batwoman</a></em> that had Flamebird referencing her past as a Titan (which never happened in the New 52) and a battle with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Deathstroke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Deathstroke">Deathstroke</a> was also edited out in the collected edition.
</li></ul></li><li> Some dialogue from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2011">Batgirl</a> #37</em> was changed for the TPB collection to remove the implication that Barbara Gordon was shocked and disgusted to discover that an apparently female villain was a cross-dressing man, which had been seen by readers as out-of-character and transphobic.
</li><li> The original printing of <em>We Can Never Go Home</em> #3 had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CostumeTestMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CostumeTestMontage">Costume-Test Montage</a> where Maddie was seen dressed as trademarked heroines like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MsMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MsMarvel">Ms. Marvel</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PowerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PowerGirl">Power Girl</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Zatanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Zatanna">Zatanna</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Watchmen">Silk Spectre</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JudgeDredd">Judge Anderson</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TankGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TankGirl">Tank Girl</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSandman">Death</a>. A number of the outfits had to be omitted in the trade paperback, but were replaced with the costumes of <em>other</em> recognizable characters, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Storm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Storm">Storm</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Psylocke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Psylocke">Psylocke</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Robin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Robin">Robin</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl">Batgirl</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/DoctorWhoMagazine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/DoctorWhoMagazine">Doctor Who Magazine</a></em> story "The Crystal Throne" had dialogue changes in the collected edition to a scene where Strax encounters a Sikh man. The initial comedy dialogue, intended to be Strax being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive">Innocently Insensitive</a>, apparently came across as too similar to racist humour that Sikh readers had experienced being directed at them in real life.
</li><li> The first <em>X-Men: X-Tinction Agenda</em> collection removes two pages, adding two new pages to eliminate mentioning a subplot. Fixed in the later hardcover edition.
</li><li> The original version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke">The Killing Joke</a></em> uses the "new look" Batman costume with the yellow oval behind the bat insignia, which Batman was still wearing in the main comics in 1988. When <em>The Killing Joke</em> was digitally recolored in 2008, the yellow oval was <a class="urllink" href="http://comicsalliance.com/files/2010/09/batmanbolland.jpg">removed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> from every single panel, leaving just the bat, because in 2008 Batman no longer had the oval. This change is baffling since no other attempts were made to modernize the story, which is still canonically set when Batman still had the oval.
</li><li> A miscommunication in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DetectiveComicsRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DetectiveComicsRebirth">Detective Comics (Rebirth)</a></em> led to a scene showing a Christian cross on the tombstone of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batwoman">Batwoman</a>'s mother, even though she and her family are Jewish. The digital and collected editions edited out the cross and replaced it with a Star of David.
<ul><li> Another miscommunication led to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ra's al Ghul</span> being revealed as the mystery villain in <em>All-Star Batman</em>. Collected editions edited it out.
</li></ul></li><li> The first teaser poster of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGeddon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGeddon">Spider-Geddon</a></em>, a story featuring several characters of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> franchise, included the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderWoman">Spider-Woman</a> from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em> comics. The poster was silently fixed later to feature the 616 Spider-Woman instead in that spot, and in the same pose. Clearly the artist received a list of characters for the poster, but that list was not clear about <em>which</em> Spider-Woman to include. The mistake may be justified because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a> universe was a major alternate universe, and Ultimate Spider-Woman (under the name "Black Widow" at the time) had already been used in the previous project of this type, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderVerse">Spider-Verse</a></em>.

<ul><li> This trope is par for the course in fanfiction, with <em>many</em> authors revising early chapters of their fics, either to improve the writing quality or to fix inconsistencies.
</li><li> When Durandall wanted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retcon</a> something in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/KyonBigDamnHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/KyonBigDamnHero">Kyon: Big Damn Hero</a></em>, it was easiest for him just to go back and change the chapters themselves. Usually, this only applied to character names.
</li><li> In chapter 7 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheLongingverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheLongingverse">The Last Crystal Unicorn</a></em>, Shimmering Ruby insults Shining Armor, calling him "retarded" behind his back. This was found to be offensive by many, so the insult was changed to "pitiful".
</li><li> A minor example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/MassEffectInterregnum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/MassEffectInterregnum">Mass Effect Interregnum</a></em>. When the game's <em>Lair of the Shadow Broker</em> DLC was released, it included a list of Garrus's squadmates. Several of them had been included in the fic with original names, so the characters in question were renamed to match.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/SylviaTheSylveon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/SylviaTheSylveon">Sylvia the Sylveon</a></em>, Moondancer's nickname was Moonie, which was meant to be a reference to early 90s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> fans. But after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> were pointed out, the author changed it to Dancer.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/FutariWaPrettyCureBlueMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/FutariWaPrettyCureBlueMoon">Futari Wa Pretty Cure Blue Moon</a></em>, some characters had brown or black hair, but the author decided there was too many brown and black haired characters, so their hair colors were changed to more wild ones, the most notable being the now green haired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Emiru.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RedFireRedPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RedFireRedPlanet">Red Fire, Red Planet</a></em> had the author discover he'd made a mistake with an Andorian minor character, giving him the wrong <a class="urllink" href="http://memory-beta.wikia.com/wiki/Andorian_genders">Andorian gender honorifics<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NimbusLlewelyn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NimbusLlewelyn">Nimbus Llewelyn</a> occasionally does in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm">Child of the Storm</a></em>. The changes are usually minor, and made after someone points out a mistake. This is not always the case, however - once he added over 4,000 words to a chapter in the form of an extra scene or two.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SoulEaterTroubledSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SoulEaterTroubledSouls">Soul Eater: Troubled Souls</a></em>: CD/Grade, the author, constantly goes back to edit, readjust, and add little bits of information to the story.

Among them included adding an earlier mention of the Doors to the Realms In Between (one had already existed later in the story), and changing one of Elusive's lines into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigYes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigYes">Big "YES!"</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/DavionAndDavionDeceased" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/DavionAndDavionDeceased">Davion &amp; Davion (Deceased)</a></em> originally had the family of Commodore Grec escape the Amaris Coup as they were invited to New Avalon. The author later wrote Grec as bereaved by the Coup, amending the previous reference to indicate that he declined to invite his family as it was a privilege other soldiers couldn't share, something that more than justified his later emotional distress.

<ul><li> Several movies from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon">Disney Animated Canon</a> have had this done to them:
<ul><li> In one scene in the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VCR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VCR">VHS</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LaserDisc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LaserDisc">LaserDisc</a> releases of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994">The Lion King</a></em>, a dust cloud kicked up by Simba seems to form the word "SEX." Although the animators claimed that it actually said "SFX" (special effects), the scene still got edited in later editions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin">Aladdin</a></em>:
<ul><li> The opening song describes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArabianNightsDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArabianNightsDays">Agrabah</a> as a "barbaric" locale "where they cut off your ear if they don't like your face." In response to complaints about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> of that line, later editions replaced it with "where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense" (though you can still find the original lyrics in some foreign dubs and on the original CD release).
</li><li> At one point in the movie, Aladdin gets attacked by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantheraAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantheraAwesome">tiger</a> Rajah and says, "Come on...good kitty, take off and go...". Due to other, simultaneous noises (possibly Rajah snarling), it's hard to understand what he says, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen">some people said it sounded like</a> "Good teenagers, take off your clothes." The line was later cut out in the DVD release, only to be restored for the Blu-ray release just over a decade later.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fantasia">Fantasia</a></em>: In one scene in the original film, several young black centaurettes with donkey bodies (the one with the most screentime was nicknamed Sunflower) are seen performing menial duties for the beautiful Aryan centaurettes and for Bacchus. Needless to say, later audiences considered this unacceptable, and Sunflower and friends have mysteriously disappeared from all releases after 1969. The two lighter-skinned zebra centaurettes who attend Bacchus got some of their scenes trimmed as well, including a scene where one is trying to help the very drunk Bacchus down from a gazebo. Furthermore, Disney has cracked down on videos on the Internet showing footage of the unedited scenes, so good luck finding any evidence of the original version.

<ul><li> This is not the first Orwellian Retcon in the franchise. When the first film was released in 1977, the opening crawl did not contain "Episode IV - A New Hope". After it became a runaway success, it was re-released to cinemas with this added, and thus began Lucas' claim that there had always been a nine-movie plan.
</li></ul></li><li> Director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelMann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelMann">Michael Mann</a> suppressed copies of the original theatrical cut of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LastOfTheMohicans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LastOfTheMohicans">Last of the Mohicans</a></em> after some fans expressed displeasure at removal of scenes and music from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedSpecialCollectorsUltimateEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedSpecialCollectorsUltimateEdition">director's cut</a> which Mann decided he didn't like ten years later. Various character-driven scenes were excised and action scenes added; complicating things, choice bits of dialogue were edited in, but the overall length of the film didn't change due to the volume of cuts. Altered sound design consisted of recycled bits of soundtrack, with the volume turned down. To this day, the theatrical cut is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">only available in Europe</a>.
</li><li> The original showings of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture">Star Trek: The Motion Picture</a></em> had dialogue describing the VGER cloud as being "Over 82 A.U.s in diameter." Subsequent prints and the DVD release edited the dialogue slightly so now it is described as being "Over 2 A.U.s in diameter," which better fits with the established canon for how fast the Enterprise travels under impulse power over the timeframe of the movie. (Earlier video releases, such as the widescreen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LaserDisc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LaserDisc">LaserDisc</a> of the theatrical cut and the 4:3 extended TV cut, do retain the 82.)
</li><li> The phone number in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BruceAlmighty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BruceAlmighty">Bruce Almighty</a></em> was not originally an example of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveFiveFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveFiveFive">555</a> trope; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Universal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Universal">Universal</a> digitally altered all releases after the original theatrical print because the original number turned out to actually belong to people in various area codes. Even more confusingly, although the English audio track was overdubbed to match the new number, the French dub on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DVD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DVD">DVD</a> <em>wasn't</em>, no doubt leaving many Francophones confused as to why the number on screen didn't match the one read out by Bruce.
</li><li> The extended edition film of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheReturnOfTheKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheReturnOfTheKing">The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</a></em> changed the time of day for Pippin finding Merry on Pelennor Fields from the theatre version to the DVD version, showing that Pippin had been searching for Merry for several hours rather than the few minutes implied by the theatrical version. Note that both editions have always been available on DVD.
<ul><li> The commentary track reveals that the time of day in this scene depended on whether the Houses of Healing scene was included or not, since Merry doesn't appear in it.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2fud6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2fud6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2fud6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In the book he is in that scene, though.</span> And indeed, it was cut from the theatrical version but restored in the extended edition.
</li></ul></li><li> In the original release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Traffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Traffic">Traffic</a></em>, the drug czar's daughter, a teenage drug addict, attends Cincinnati Country Day School, a private prep school in the Cincinnati, Ohio area. Amid <a class="urllink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1112349.stm">protests from school administrators who objected to the association of the school with drug use<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the reference to the school was scrubbed from the DVD release and TV broadcasts.
</li><li> Original releases of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCrush">The Crush</a></em> have the teenage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> named Darien, after a real woman the writer knew. When the real woman sued him and won, subsequent releases dubbed in the name Adrienne, with varying degrees of success.
</li><li> The original English version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsMechagodzillaII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsMechagodzillaII">Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II</a></em> was bumped up to stereo and had most of its dialogue re-dubbed by different actors when it was finally brought to the United States in 1999 by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TriStarPictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TriStarPictures">TriStar Pictures</a> for unknown reasons. The only evidence of the original version is a Hindi theatrical print made without a clean music and effects track, so English dialogue is sometimes heard unscathed.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGaiad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGaiad">The Gaiad</a></em> has its chapters frequently updated to keep up with scientific advances or to add new illustrations.
</li><li> In 1831, Mary Shelley rewrote significant portions of her 1818 novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a></em>, resulting in a much more fatalistic text.
</li><li> In response to charges of anti-Semitism in his novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OliverTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OliverTwist">Oliver Twist</a></em>, Charles Dickens eliminated most of the references to Fagin's Jewishness in later editionsin the original he was constantly referred to as "the Jew"though it is mostly the original that is read, reprinted, and studied today, while the more sanitized version has been forgotten.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame">Ender's Game</a></em> originally had the main character use the N-word, and depicted Russia in a different light (it was written during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>). Before Orson released an edited version, he told all of his fans that if they sent their copies of <em>Ender's Game</em> to him, he'd send them back free copies of another, not yet released, book of his. What did Orson do with the copies he received? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Destroyed them.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TolkiensLegendarium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TolkiensLegendarium">Tolkien's Legendarium</a></em>:
<ul><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> came out, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em> was changed to agree with it about how Bilbo got the ring from Gollum. This was touched on cleverly in the text. It was implied that the version recorded in the first edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em> was the same as the false account that Bilbo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor">told the Dwarves and recorded in his book</a>. Bilbo later confessed the truth to Gandalf, then Frodo learned of this from Gandalf <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveFiction">and edited his uncle's book</a>. Thus, the idea of Bilbo lying being out-of-character isn't dodged but made meaningful, since Gandalf found the idea of anyone giving up the ring to be very suspicious.
</li><li> Also happened with some Elvish sentences in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> itself. Some of these changes might be seen as typos that went unnoticed in the first edition, but some were clear changes.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdmondHamilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdmondHamilton">Edmond Hamilton</a>'s book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStarKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStarKings">The Star Kings</a></em>. In the original ending, the hero returned to his own time and body, and his love followed him some time later by swapping bodies with an incurably comatose girl. Once Hamilton wrote the sequel, that changed to her contacting him telepathically and saying they are working on a way to transport him into her time physically. For some reason, however, some recent printings still include the original ending.

<ul><li> Clarke rewrote the first chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildhoodsEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildhoodsEnd">Childhood's End</a></em> to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessup">The Great Politics Messup</a>. However, he does also include the original first chapter in some editions.
</li><li> In-Verse example: In <em>Ghost From The Grand Banks</em>, one of the main characters made his fortune performing Orwellian Retcons on old classic movies, digitally erasing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodySmokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodySmokes">Everybody Smokes</a> trope by replacing such films' omnipresent cigarettes and pipes with lollipops, chewed pencils, etc.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RASalvatore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RASalvatore">R.A. Salvatore</a> changed some details of Drizzt's backstory in later drafts of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIcewindDaleTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIcewindDaleTrilogy">The Icewind Dale Trilogy</a></em> so as to better fit his expanded conception of the character's origins in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkElfTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkElfTrilogy">The Dark Elf Trilogy</a></em>. Specifically, the line "Two hundred years of living many miles below ground had not been erased by five years on the sunlit surface. To this day, sunlight drained and dizzied him." The prequel trilogy's timeline established that Drizzt was only in his mid-forties or so.
</li><li> The chronologically last book of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnchantedForestChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnchantedForestChronicles">Enchanted Forest Chronicles</a>, <em>Talking to Dragons</em>, was written first. When it was republished, some minor changes were made to make it agree with the other books.
</li><li> Happens a lot in reprints of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EnidBlyton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EnidBlyton">Enid Blyton</a> stories, partly to change money references to decimal currency but also covering minor plot points (one novel has the characters bribing a girl with chocolate, rather than money as in the original). However, a scene in <em>Secret Seven Fireworks</em> where the Seven accidentally set fire to the shed where they've stored their fireworks and set them all off was rewritten to have the shed instead containing their guy (presumably because that was considered less dangerous), meaning they acquire a new guy by the next chapter and the original ending of the police giving them new fireworks as a thank you was lost. (The novel also alters all references to them buying fireworks to their parents buying them for them, to cover modern age restrictions on sales.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a> rewrote and expanded large portions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGunslinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGunslinger">the first volume</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower">The Dark Tower</a></em> to "better fit in" with the later books. This included <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconning</a> all of the villains from Roland's past as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsASmallWorldAfterAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsASmallWorldAfterAll">same guy</a>. Since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGunslinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGunslinger">The Gunslinger</a></em> as originally written is composed in a style unlike King's later works, and features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">call backs</a> to story elements that were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityLockOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityLockOut">never expanded on</a> in the finished work.
</li><li> King's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStand">The Stand</a></em> was originally set in 1980. Subsequent printings were set in 1985, then the uncut version in the 1990s (with references to AIDS and a few other cultural changes).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrekExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrekExpandedUniverse">Star Trek Expanded Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one of the more famous examples in literature, at least among Trekkers, Della van Hise's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> novel <em>Killing Time</em> was released and then almost immediately recalled when it was discovered that the author was a former K/S <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlashFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlashFic">Slash Fic</a> writer, and that this comes through blatantly in the original text of the novel<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3u62v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3u62v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3u62v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">no, the originally published manuscript wasn't <em>explicitly</em> K/S, but the subtext was considerably heavier</span>. The next edition had the worst of the subtext edited out, but original copies can still be found on eBay and in used bookstores, and many K/S fans actively hunt them out.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianeDuane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianeDuane">Diane Duane</a> made some minor edits to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Rihannsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Rihannsu">Rihannsu</a></em> to clean up internal continuity when the first four books of five were re-released as an omnibus edition in the early 2000s.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianeDuane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianeDuane">Diane Duane</a> has released edited "New Millennium Edition" versions of the first nine books of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards">Young Wizards</a></em> series to clean up the timeline. Seeing as the series had been published over the course of thirty years at that point, each was set in the present day at time of publication, and yet Kit and Nita had only grown a couple of years... it was probably for the best.
</li><li> Small-scale example: Any reprint of the early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Eragon</a></em> books now marks them as the Inheritance Cycle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrilogyCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrilogyCreep">instead of the</a> Inheritance Trilogy.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4z38q');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4z38q" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4z38q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which has the added benefit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimilarlyNamedWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimilarlyNamedWorks">avoiding confusion</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceTrilogy">another book series</a>.</span>
</li><li> The previous publisher of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AvalonWebOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AvalonWebOfMagic">Avalon: Web of Magic</a></em> went bankrupt. In the switch to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SevenSeasEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SevenSeasEntertainment">Seven Seas Entertainment</a>, the author revised the books to avoid plot holes and ridiculous behavior.
</li><li> The original Oompa-Loompas of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a></em> were black, and specifically mentioned to be from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestAfrica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestAfrica">Darkest Africa</a>. After numerous people pointed out the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> of Willy Wonka as a slave owner, later printings changed them to the white and somewhat hippie-ish inhabitants of Loompaland. Additionally, the character of Veruca Salt was originally known as Veruca Cruz.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Later editions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone">Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</a></em> were edited to make Nearly Headless Nick's claimed age match with the age given for him in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets">Chamber of Secrets</a></em>. Also in <em>Philosopher's Stone</em>, Hagrid originally stated he had to "give Sirius his bike back". This was later contradicted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></em> where Sirius gave the bike to Hagrid and told him to keep it before disappearing. Later editions of <em>Philosopher's Stone</em> rectified this by having Hagrid just say he had to put the bike away.
</li><li> Early editions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</a></em> have Dumbledore tell Harry that Voldemort is the last living <em>ancestor</em> of Salazar Slytherin, even though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord">the word "descendant" was obviously meant</a>. This was of course eventually changed, but not before inspiring some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackFic">humorous</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">Epileptic Trees</a>. Also in the same book, Lockhart mentions that one of the less-than-photogenic people he stole credit from was a witch with a "harelip" (an outdated term for a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleft_lip_and_palate">cleft lip<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), which was changed to a "hairy chin" in later editions.
</li><li> In the first American printing of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a></em>, a mistake made by Rowling (in both the British and US-market editions) made it so the order in which the shadows of Harry's parents come out of Voldemort's wand contradicts the order in which Voldemort said he killed them, launching a thousand fan theories. This was corrected in later editions.
</li><li> In the original edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a></em>, it's a minor plot point that prefects can't take house points. However, this contradicts an earlier scene in <em>Chamber Of Secrets</em> in which Percy takes points off Ron. Later editions of <em>Phoenix</em> altered the dialogue so that the rule is that prefects can't take points off other prefects.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnitaBlake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnitaBlake">Narcissus In Chains</a></em> by Laurell K Hamilton, the hardcover version of the book contained a scene where the main character was raped. All other editions of the book have had edits made so that it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubCon">merely questionable</a> as to how willing she was (mostly dialogue changes so that she's not flat out saying "no, I don't want to.")
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew">Nancy Drew</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HardyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HardyBoys">Hardy Boys</a></em> series underwent a major retcon of their first stories beginning in 1959 (the first 34 for Nancy, 38 for the Hardys). Ostensibly to remove dated slang and racist stereotypes, and also to make the stories shorter and faster-paced, this led to a realization that some stories simply fell apart otherwise, so more than a few of the books were completely new stories with nothing but the title being the same. Purists of the two series have criticized the revised books as being bland and sanitized. The original volumes can be found through reprints from niche publisher Applewood Books.
</li><li> A reissue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HuckleberryFinn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HuckleberryFinn">Huckleberry Finn</a></em> in 2011 omitted the N-words, exchanging the word "slave" where appropriate.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie">Agatha Christie</a>'s book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndThenThereWereNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndThenThereWereNone">And Then There Were None</a></em> was originally called <em>Ten Little Niggers</em> in the UK. Then it was <em>Ten Little Indians</em> before that term for Native Americans fell out of politically correct language, resulting in its current title. In the novel, the rhyme was changed from <em>Ten Little Niggers</em> to <em>Ten Little Indians</em> to <em>Ten Little Soldier Boys</em>, and the name of the island from <em>Nigger Island</em> to <em>Indian Island</em> then to <em>Soldier Island</em>. The U.S. edition has always used the title "And Then There Were None".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLorax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLorax">The Lorax</a></em> there was originally a line that joked about how polluted Lake Erie was. Some environmentalists pointed out to Dr. Seuss that there were efforts to clean up the lake. So reprints have changed the Lake Erie line. It can still be heard in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a> however.
</li><li> The "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Fudge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Fudge">Fudge</a>" books by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyBlume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyBlume">Judy Blume</a> were edited in post-2002 reprints to, among other things, replace references to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow">The Muppet Show</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheElectricCompany1971" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheElectricCompany1971">The Electric Company (1971)</a></em> with references to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a>, replace vinyl record players with CD players, and in <em>Sheila the Great</em>, change the reason the characters are using a mimeograph machine (in 1972, it was because they hadn't gotten a copier yet. In 2002, it was because the copier broke).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em> was slightly edited after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLostWorld1995" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLostWorld1995">The Lost World (1995)</a></em> was published to remove reference to Dr. Malcolm's death, to support his retcon back into existence for the sequel.
</li><li> In <em>Just Me and You</em>, the first of Mercer Mayer's "Little Critter" books, at one point, Little Critter is threatened with being spanked. This was changed in recent reprints to have him being threatened with getting a "time-out".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBabySittersClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBabySittersClub">The Baby-Sitters Club</a></em> was revised somewhat in later printings, as editors tried to reconcile a few inconsistencies made by Ann M. Martin and ghostwriters:
<ul><li> In the original <em>Kristy's Big Idea</em>, Kristy is described as wearing a skirt and blouse. As Kristy would later be established as only liking sweaters and jeans, this detail was changed to fit that. Her mother's name was also originally given as "Edie Thomas", but as Martin later referred to her as "Elizabeth", this was also corrected in later editions.
</li><li> Karen's mother and stepfather were originally named "Sheila" and "Kendall" in <em>Kristy's Big Day</em>. Reprints corrected their names to be "Lisa" and "Seth", the names that Martin would settle on when writing <em>Baby Sitters' Little Sister</em>.
</li><li> An early edition of one <em>Little Sister</em> book had Karen concoct various plans of revenge on a boy that bullied her. One idea was her saying that she'd tell him he was adopted. After parents complained about the implications of that passage, this was changed to Karen's plan being "Tell him I will never ever speak to him again".
</li></ul></li><li> Reprints of the Norwegian edition of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PippiLongstocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PippiLongstocking">Pippi Longstocking</a> books by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AstridLindgren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AstridLindgren">Astrid Lindgren</a> rewrite Pippi's father's title from "negerkonge" (Negro King) to "sydhavskonge" (King of the Southern Seas), due to the, well, you know what.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Imaro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Imaro">Imaro</a></em> when first released in 1981 had a chapter called "Slaves of the Giant-Kings" with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Cultures</a> of the Tutsi and Hutu of Rwanda and Imaro incites a bloody rebellion against the Tutsi. Then in 1994 the Rwandan Genocide happened where the Hutu slaughtered the Tutsi. When author Charles Saunders finally reprinted <em>Imaro</em> in 2006 he removed "Slaves of the Giant-Kings" entirely, replacing it with "The Afua". In addition, Saunders moved the chapter "The City of Madness" to the start of <em>Imaro 2: The Quest for Cush</em> and replaced it with "Betrayal in Blood" since in the original publication there was a large gap between "The City of Madness" and the preceding chapter while "Betrayal in Blood" bridges that gap.
</li><li> <em>Darkspell</em>, the second book in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deverry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deverry">Deverry</a></em> series, was later released in a revised edition. Some of the changes were made to bring the book more in lime with how the author originally envisioned it, before her editor overruled it. For instance, Sarcyn is redeemed in the new version instead of going insane and his brother has been replaced with a sister, whose role has been drastically reduced. Also, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThievesGuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThievesGuild">Thieves' Guild</a> in one town was changed into just a father and his son, because the author came to realize that the town wasn't large enough to support a fully-fledged thieves' guild.
</li><li> Older books in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidDetective">Kid Detective</a> series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeInvestigators" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeInvestigators">The Three Investigators</a></em> were reedited to replace <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a> with fictional stand-ins after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> Hitch's death.
</li><li> After much demand from fans, and profiteering by secondhand book dealers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>'s first novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCarpetPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCarpetPeople">The Carpet People</a></em> was eventually republished. However, it was heavily rewritten, partly to remove bad writing but also to replace the conventional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy">High Fantasy</a> monarchism and glorification of war of the original with the more democratic and pacifist political outlook of Pratchett's mature novels.
</li><li> Recent reprints of the older <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GeronimoStilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GeronimoStilton">Geronimo Stilton</a></em> books have many illustrations replaced or partially redrawn to replace Trap's old design<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5ymug');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5ymug" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5ymug');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">White shirt, red suspenders and blue pants</span> with the one introduced around volume 31-32 of the main series<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6kfu3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6kfu3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6kfu3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Yellow and green Hawaiian shirt, reddish brown shorts, and also an earring and a ponytail</span>. The partially redrawn ones <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure">are the most obvious ones</a>, since the new, digitally colored parts are drawn over the original watercolored pictures.
</li><li> The second book of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBookOfTheDunCow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBookOfTheDunCow">Book of the Dun Cow</a></em> series, <em>The Book of Sorrows</em>, was rewritten and reissued some time later as <em>Lamentations</em>. The new version differs in writing style, changes various plot points, and both introduces new characters and removes existing ones from <em>Sorrows</em>. This was to bring the series in line with the final book, <em>Peace at the Last</em>, which followed the rewritten continuity.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelMoorcock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelMoorcock">Michael Moorcock</a>:
<ul><li> Two different works were edited in later editions, because the first editions appeared to endorse rape in certain circumstances and Moorcock was convinced by feminist criticism that this was morally wrong:
<ul><li> In the ending of the first edition of <em>Gloriana</em>, Quire successfully gives Gloriana her first ever orgasm and ends the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FisherKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FisherKing">barrenness of her kingdom</a> by raping her. In later editions, when he tries to, she overpowers him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale">rapes him</a> with the same result.
</li><li> At the end of the first version of "The Transformation of Miss Mavis Ming", the Fireclown cures Mavis of her uptightness and right-wing politics by raping her. In later editions, he does it by whipping her until she has an emotional breakdown, which may or may not be an actual improvement.
</li></ul></li><li> On a smaller scale, many 1990s and 2000s reprints of early Moorcock works changed the names of certain characters to make them members of the von Bek or Cornelius families, or to turn originally unconnected villains into versions of Johannes Klosterheim or Gaynor the Damned (sometimes also using the latter's pseudonym in more modern or futuristic settings of Paul van/von Minct).

Generally this was done to fix a mistake that was detected almost immediately after the first airing, such as Sheridan's old ship (the <em>Agamemnon</em>) opening fire on civilian transports in "Moments of Transition" (changed to the <em>Pollux</em> later), and Sheridan's notorious reference in "Comes the Inquisitor" to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackTheRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackTheRipper">Jack the Ripper</a> murders happening in the "West End of London".

</li><li> Done on, of all shows, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune">Wheel of Fortune</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnnouncer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnnouncer">The Announcer</a> Charlie O'Donnell died in November 2010, barely two months into the 28th season. Naturally this meant that other announcers would fill in, but where this trope comes into play is with the episodes Charlie had taped which had not yet aired. Deciding that it would be "too sad" to hear his voice posthumously, the producers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SameLanguageDub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SameLanguageDub">dubbed Charlie's voice over with those of the fill-ins</a>. This came into play <em>again</em> during the summer rerun cycle in 2011: as Jim Thornton had been chosen as the permanent replacement, <em>he</em> was dubbed over everyone else on the reruns — including a few episodes originally announced by Charlie, meaning that some were overdubbed twice!

<ul><li> Mark Ronson's <em>Uptown Funk!</em> had co-writer credit given to Trinidad James from sampling <em>All Gold Everything</em>, The Gap Band for similar elements to <em>Oops, Upside Your Head</em>, and the producers involved with all three bands.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> did this twice and didn't announce it. After the success of the Rock With You single - which was itself a remix, as was the B-Side Get On The Floor - the album Off The Wall was reissued with the single mixes replacing the album versions, unannounced, which remains to this day. The same thing happened with the album Bad, which had numerous differences, most notably a spoken intro to I Just Can't Stop Loving You. The 2001 remasters presented retained the revised tracklistings. Enough people kicked up a fuss about the Bad album being changed that the original mix (albeit remastered) was reused for Bad 25.
<ul><li> Michael had three changes to his albums that were announced, however - Ben had the cover changed to remove the rats (Ben is supposed to be Michael's pet rat) because they were apparently scaring kids, History was revised to contain an edited version of 'They Don't Care About Us' (due to containing the line 'jew me, kike me' which was considered offensive), and Off The Wall's cover was changed to just showing his lower half on the US pressings and the 2001 remaster because it was thought that younger fans would not realise it was the same Michael (prior to his skin bleaching and hair straightening).
<ul><li> After Michael's death, newspapers that had accused him of being a pedophile stopped doing so and praised him instead, acting like there had never been any accusations, though a new set of allegations against him surfaced in early 2019 following the HBO documentary <em>Leaving Neverland</em>. This naturally confused their audiences, some of whom were quite vocal about it.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em>Stay With Me</em> by Sam Smith, James Napier and William Phillips had similarities to <em>I Wont Back Down</em> by Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne, who were retroactively given co-writer credit on <em>Stay With Me</em>.
</li><li> Wham's 2011 reissue of The Final (with a DVD of the video release) presented it as the 'original album' and played on the nostalgia of people who would have bought it on vinyl or cassette in 1986. However, the reissue is based on the CD release, which was released later and doesn't contain Blue (Armed With Love), the extended mixes of Bad Boys, Careless Whisper and I'm Your Man. As Blue is pretty rare on CD, this was widely seen as a missed opportunity.
</li><li> After Rolf Harris' conviction for indecent assault, his vocals were removed from subsequent reissues of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KateBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KateBush">Kate Bush</a>'s <em>Aerial</em> and replaced with her son Bertie.
</li><li> After the first 3 million copies were sold, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Weezer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Weezer">Weezer</a>'s self-titled debut had the album mix of "Say It Ain't So" quietly replaced by a single remix at the band's request - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNotRemix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNotRemix">the difference is barely noticeable anyway</a>. A deluxe version of the album included the original mix as a bonus track.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder9');">    Newspaper Comics </div><div class="folder" id="folder9" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> It's very common for books of newspaper comic collections to revise, edit, or just outright omit comic strips the artist disliked on first run. Since it's quite difficult to track down "original" strips as they first ran in newspapers, this is one form of media where Orwellian Retconning can be almost undetectable and thus extremely successful.
<ul><li> In <em>The Prehistory of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheFarSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheFarSide">The Far Side</a></em> Gary Larson admits to doing this on several occasions. For example, one comic involved a vampire watching a TV ad boasting "when you're out of A-positive, you're out of blood!" with the caption "Your Vampire TV station." Larson admitted finding that caption redundant, and sure enough it never accompanies the comic in any other Far Side collection or calendar.
</li></ul></li><li> An early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot">FoxTrot</a></em> strip had Jason recording an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnsweringMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnsweringMachine">answering machine message</a> proclaiming that the caller dialed "Satan Hotline". When the strip was reprinted in book collections, it was changed so that Jason was singing "A million bottles of beer on the wall."
<ul><li> Another strip featured Andy, high on decongestant, realizing that she was surfing the television when it was off, which lead her to claim "I thought Oprah looked extra-black". Given the unfortunate implication with the dialogue, it was changed to "I thought Bill O'Reilly seemed a little soft-spoken" in reprint collections.
</li></ul></li><li> This was played with in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert">Dilbert</a></em> comic, when Topper says he passed a gallstone so big it became the Secretary of Labor in the Clinton Administration.
<div class="indent"><strong>Receptionist:</strong> I find that hard to believe.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Topper:</strong> Give me ten minutes and then check <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>.
</div></li><li> <em>The Complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a></em> book-set had some of the dialogues altered:
<ul><li> A strip from January 7, 1987 had the dialogue "Was I adopted?" changed to "Was I genetically engineered or cloned?".
</li><li> A similar change was done for the November 25, 1988 strip, where mentions of "biological mother" was changed to "a good mother."
</li><li> A strip from November 24, 1987 had Calvin's dad's explanation for why the weather is getting colder altered so that it's more scientifically correct.
</li></ul></li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ForBetterOrForWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ForBetterOrForWorse">For Better or for Worse</a></em> entered reruns, several older strips had their artworks altered, from seat belts being added when characters are driving to Ellie reacting more angrily to John (this was after Lynn Johnston divorced her husband, who was the basis for the character). This is, however, averted in <em>The Complete Library</em> hardcover reprint, where the book editor is taking great pains to restore the strip close to the original version as possible.
</li><li> A retcon that was done because of an error: a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/PearlsBeforeSwine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/PearlsBeforeSwine">Pearls Before Swine</a></em> strip from <a class="urllink" href="https://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2016/02/07">February 7, 2016<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> accidentally ruined a pun in the next-to-last panel, where Pig said "I want to be your <em>friend</em>" instead of "I want to be your <em>Fred</em>" (this is based on a lyrics from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a> song "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BornToRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BornToRun">Born to Run</a>"). In the online edition and subsequent reprint in book collections, it was corrected so Pig said "Fred".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheFamilyCircus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheFamilyCircus">The Family Circus</a></em> frequently reuses panels, either with the same joke or a new one that fits the art. These panels are generally redrawn to update any technology (although the wood-panelled CRT television remains an exception), and sometimes reworked to update other things as well (like a rerun "We're going to Disneyland!" storyline that made a point of referencing the most recent attractions). As with <em>FBOFW</em>, scenes in cars have seat-belts added.
</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield">Garfield</a></em> strip for October 20, 2002 <a class="urllink" href="https://www.mezzacotta.net/garfield/?comic=2799">originally<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had Garfield reciting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertFrost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertFrost">Robert Frost</a>'s "Nothing Gold Can Stay". However the poem was still under copyright when it ran so <a class="urllink" href="https://garfield.com/comic/2002/10/20">it was replaced with an original poem in reprints.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (The poem has since lapsed into public domain as of 2019).

<ul><li> Ever since the World Wrestling Federation were forced to change their name to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">World Wrestling Entertainment</a> in 2002, they've made sure to remove all references to the letters WWF and the "Federation". This is partly because of not being allowed to use the acronym for legal reasons, and wanting to make the rebranding as absolute as possible. Which means that older wrestlers like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage">Randy Savage</a> are referred to as "former WWE wrestlers", even if their runs with the company took place long before the name change, and making edits whenever a wrestler or announcer mentions "WWF" on DVD releases of pre-2002 footage. Averted on the UK licensed DVDs which, through some legal loophole, can be released unedited. Averted with the release of the WWE Network, as footage from the WWF days can be found there unedited due to a licensing agreement between them and the World Wide Fund for Nature.
</li><li> Trisa Hayes had appeared in <em>Penthouse</em> some time prior to her surprise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW">ECW</a> debut as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BeulahMcGillicutty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BeulahMcGillicutty">Beulah McGillicutty</a> at <em>ECW Hostile City Showdown 95</em>. However, because WWE had a working relationship with <em>Playboy</em> at the time that the <em>Rise &amp; Fall of ECW</em> DVD was released in 2004, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TommyDreamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TommyDreamer">Tommy Dreamer</a> had to say that she had been a <em>Playboy</em> Playmate. For the record, Tommy Dreamer, real name Thomas Laughlin, is <em>married</em> to Trisa Hayes in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>. Yes, WWE made Tommy Dreamer lie about what magazine his <em>wife</em> had appeared in prior to her ECW debut.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SidEudy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SidEudy">Sid Justice</a> eliminated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> at <em>Royal Rumble 1992</em>, fans cheered and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GorillaMonsoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GorillaMonsoon">Gorilla Monsoon</a> responded as if it was fair. While the home video version kept the original reaction and commentary, the recap on <em>Superstars</em> in the weeks after was edited to remove the cheering, and Monsoon actually re-recorded his commentary to cast Justice in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">negative light</a>.
</li><li> Normally, the debut of a company's new logo would be greeted with much fanfare. However, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> decided to update their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">"scratch" logo</a> into a more modern, sleeker logo, there was not one mention of the new logo made on-air, despite it replacing the old WWE logo on almost everything (microphones, stage, announce table, backstage interview area, turnbuckles, the patch on the referees' shirts, etc.). Making it doubly bad is the fact that the supposedly "new and improved" WWE Championship was to be revealed that night, but what was revealed was a belt exactly the same as the old WWE Championship, only with the new logo instead of the old. So in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">Kayfabe</a>, no one exactly knew what was so new and improved about the belt, as it was never mentioned by anyone on air.

For example, in <em>Dino Attack RPG</em>, Dr. Cyborg's revelation of Pterisa's origins vanished without a trace after <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Andrewnuva199" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Andrewnuva199">Andrewnuva 199</a> asked avmatoran to retcon it.

<ul><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> ended the Squat race, reprintings of books where Squat characters appear had them deleted, turned into humans or Ratlings although they do get a mention since the sixth edition rulebook.
</li><li> Done humorously with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em> franchise, where the much-reviled fifth edition of the game has been officially declared an unproduct.
</li><li> In general most publications for Tabletop RPGs avoid explicitly mentioning the Edition of the book, as if it's the only version of the game ever produced. This can be somewhat frustrating when shopping for used books, although the internet has made it substantially easier.

<ul><li> While most content updates in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> added new missions and story arcs, there were occasions when the developers would go back and redo existing missions that were badly designed (making them very unpopular with the players) or that were contradicted by changes to the game lore. The infamous Positron Task Force was completely rewritten from the ground up after years of overwhelming negative feedback from players.
<ul><li> This also could happen frequently with the Mission Architect feature as it was possible for the author to edit a story arc that they have published without taking it down and republishing. The arc still had the same ID number and player ratings, but could very well have been changed into a completely different story if the author so chose.
<ul><li> Sometimes this was necessary as a exploit fix could have unintended consequences for authors who didn't try to write farming missions and now had to make changes to fix their damaged story arc.

The re-releases of <em>Metal Gear 2</em> in particular also changed all of the realistic character portraits into ones drawn similarly to the style of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> illustrator Yoji Shinkawa, since all of the portraits in the MSX2 version were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookFantasyCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookFantasyCasting">trace-overs of real-life celebrities</a> (which could've led to Konami facing legal problems if they were kept due to the unauthorized use of people's likenesses).

Also, the text of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousLatinChanting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousLatinChanting">Ominous Latin Chanting</a> in the Fire Temple was originally an Islamic prayer. Both were changed in subsequent releases of the game to remove the Islamic references entirely.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Submachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Submachine">Submachine</a> 1: The Basement</em> is actually the third version of the original <em>Submachine</em>. Amongst the changes are the inclusion of a teleporter device and a Wisdom Gem, both fundamental concepts in the later <em>Submachine</em> games.
</li><li> As with the anime/manga example above, any attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre">Macekre</a> a video game from Japan, South Korea and Europe could be seen as an attempt at this by some game players.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> altered and expanded on its ending after major fan backlash. Most of the changes were done to avoid any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferredHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferredHolocaust">Inferred Holocausts</a>, make the endings more bittersweet than unintentionally bleak, and give a bit more insight into how the final choice shaped the universe. The reaction to these changes were mostly positive. The <em>Leviathan</em> DLC goes even further and has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the eponymous Leviathans mentioning the AI behind the Reapers, the Catalyst, which has relatively no build up in the main game</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GameFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GameFreak">Game Freak</a> received criticism over Jynx's design in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> franchise over her similarity to the blackface stereotype. (This was not intentional—but what Jynx is <em>really</em> based on is controversial itself.) They resolved this issue by changing Jynx's face from black to purple, including for remakes of old games, as well as promptly replacing any images of Jynx with a black face with new artwork where her face is purple wherever possible and recoloring the episode of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">the anime</a> that started up the whole debate. This proved futile with the English dub, though (see Anime &amp; Manga section above).

This made the moral choice (left over from the previous version) of what to do with her and the Borg tech she's experimenting on no actual choice at all.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> and most later ports of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>, the scene in which Locke meets Celes is censored to remove the Imperial soldiers beating her onscreen, which Squaresoft considered necessary in the age of video game ratings systems in order to get the desired rating in Japan.

The king and half the knights were killed by Nidhogg and the remaining knights stole away with Nidhogg's eyes and claimed Ratatoskr's power as their own.

Then it turns black to make him more like a traditional ninja (and because Fighter and Red Mage are already very, very red). When the other warriors call him on it, he claims it's always been black... and when that comic went up, the author went back and edited <em>every single page</em> in which Thief is wearing the ninja uniform (even some very old pages, where Thief is wearing the ninja uniform in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward">Flash Forwards</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spots</a>), to make that uniform black.
</li><li> There is a device in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/CityOfReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/CityOfReality">City of Reality</a></em> that is made to do <em>this and this alone</em>. It is brought to Reality by a thief who uses it to predict the every move, and later used by Hawk, who uses it to be "perfect" at everything, until it falls back into the thieves hands. Later, it turns out it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">causing freak storms threatening Reality</a>.
<ul><li> The same device is later used by the reader in a dark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebooks">Gamebook</a> in Magic World.

The first time, they failed due to the high security, but the second time around, they knew exactly what to do. The characters are still dealing with the fallout.
<ul><li> This last one is the only one that was actually retconned into the comic, with the original version available off-site.

Originally, this was <em>The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Pirates</em>, until Franklin-Covey, owners of the actual <em>Seven Habits of Highly Effective People</em>, noticed and sent what can only be described as a very polite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatWasntARequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatWasntARequest">cease and desist notice</a>.

Such as <a class="urllink" href="http://www.egscomics.com/?date=2002-02-17">Grace's reaction to Tedd's invitation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (first version didn't fit her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentFanserviceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentFanserviceGirl">Innocent Fanservice Girl</a> character), <a class="urllink" href="http://www.egscomics.com/?date=2002-06-27">Susan's reaction to meeting "Ellen" fElliot<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (first version sounded <em>really</em> out-of-character, with Susan calling "Ellen" "cutie") and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.egscomics.com/?date=2002-06-30">a conversation between the same fElliot and Sarah<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Erfworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Erfworld">Erfworld</a></em>, Bogroll's special ability was Regeneration and Deletionism was a school of magic for Naughtymancy along the Numbers axis, but was completely changed in the archives and books so that Bogroll now had Fabrication and Naughtymancy/Numbers was now "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retconjuration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retconjuration">Retconjuration</a>". Deletionism and Regeneration now only exist in the memories of fans (and the wiki). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> said that this was <a class="urllink" href="http://www.erfworld.com/2009/08/the-ultimate-naughtymancy/">because he hadn't thought the special abilities system through at that point<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Starslip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Starslip">Starslip</a></em> was originally called <em>Starshift Crisis</em>, but copyright issues with <em>StarShift: The Zaran Legacy</em> caused the starshift (the in-universe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">transportation method</a>) to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> as the "starslip", and all references in the archives were changed.
</li><li> The author of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/MeatyYogurt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/MeatyYogurt">Meaty Yogurt</a></em> had previously written <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/YumeDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/YumeDream">another comic</a> featuring a character with an odd eye. After feeling that an eye scar in Meaty Yoghurt was too reminiscent of this character, she redrew all the character's appearances with a lip scar instead.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GunnerkriggCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GunnerkriggCourt">Gunnerkrigg Court</a></em>, a few bits of dialogue in the first two chapters were quietly changed, a year or two after they first went up. For example, on <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gunnerkrigg.com/archive_page.php?comicID=7">this page<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, "<em>homme de fer</em>" was changed to "tin man" because Tom thought the French was gratuitous. Oddly enough, some further changes were made for the first volume of the print edition, but these weren't incorporated into the online archives.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em>:
<ul><li> Andrew Hussie stated that the playable human characters are supposed to be a-racial, so readers could imagine them as any race they prefer. When a reader pointed out an old page on which one of these characters was referred to as a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyFlyForAWhiteGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyFlyForAWhiteGuy">white rapper</a>", Hussie went back and replaced the word "white" with gibberish. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9u3do');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9u3do" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9u3do');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">The author has stated he had done this as a joke.</a></span> Soon afterwards, he changed it to "a white guy who is a rapper".
</li><li> Occasionally panels are posted with unintentional errors, which are quietly corrected by the author shortly afterward. For example, when the Bec's Head Base first appeared it had the troll's Sgrub logo. It was quickly changed to the standard Sburb logo. The Sufferer's death was initially depicted with less detail, and soon had more muscles and lines showing the cut of his clothes added. Another example was in a flash where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the deceased Nepeta</span> was shown without the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphetEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphetEyes">Prophet Eyes</a> of dead characters. This was also corrected, dashing hopes of a resurrection. Amusingly the opposite happened in a flashback panel where two characters that were alive at the time of the flashback were shown with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphetEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphetEyes">Prophet Eyes</a> - again, this was fixed.
</li><li> Overlapping with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong">Cut Song</a>: A dispute with a (now former) member of the music team caused a few existing flash animations to be re-done with new music. In another example, a composer had his songs removed from the fifth music album after he was caught plagiarizing. It happened again when a winner of the fan music contest did the same thing.
</li><li> Another race incident happened after one of the a-racial, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberatelyMonochrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberatelyMonochrome">Deliberately Monochrome</a> human characters got a "ridiculous game powerup" that involved a wacky palette, including peach-toned skin...and described it as feeling "Caucasian." This was initially done deliberately by the writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">to poke fun at the issue</a>, but some readers took it as an excuse for harassment, leading him to rewrite the line as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">peachy</a>".

</li><li> An early strip in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BetweenFailures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BetweenFailures">Between Failures</a></em> has Thomas using "queer" as a pejorative, which was later edited to a different insult. The creator discussed his reasons in that page's comments section - mainly that Thomas was planned to have a bad tendency to "kick down" due to his general anger and frustration in life, and that he was supposed to eventually confront and grow out of such insults. In practice, Thomas mellowed considerably faster than originally planned and so the bad habit and planned storyline went way out of tone for him and had to be discarded, with the creator going back to snip off the dangling thread.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SisterClaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SisterClaire">Sister Claire</a></em> did this for the first few comics due to Yamino not being satisfied with how the original pages turned out and some of the more juvenile humor at the time which contrasted greatly with later events of the story. As such the new pages tone down these bits and add some more context to the characters.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/EerieCuties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/EerieCuties">Eerie Cuties</a></em>, Blair using an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a> to make Brooke and Nina <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOnGirlIsHot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOnGirlIsHot">make out</a> got such an outcry from the fans that it was changed to him forcing Brooke to do a cheerleader routine instead.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DangerouslyChloe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DangerouslyChloe">Dangerously Chloe</a></em>, Abby originally looked significantly younger in her first appearance; the comic in question was edited before the next update for unclear reasons. Also, Lacy's dialogue originally suggested her lesbian parents would be disappointed with her if she started dating boys - this was changed after fan outcry to her just wanting to emulate them.
</li><li> Chris-chan had made many retcons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/Sonichu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/Sonichu">Sonichu</a></em> (such as changing names on those based on real people), but the ones made in September 2015 were noticeable. Issues 9 and 10 were altered to be less homophobic, such as replacing the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CureYourGays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CureYourGays">cure for homosexuality</a> plotpoint with a cure for "Nombie-Zazis", although some details such as the need for Chris' "straight blood" were still left intact.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/VGCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/VGCats">VG Cats</a></em> is pretty notorious for doing this anytime it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">crosses the line</a>. A joke about the death of Satoru Iwata went over so poorly that the strip that once contained the gag was heavily trimmed to almost nothing, and two entire strips were withdrawn altogether because they offended fans (one offended Bronies, another that had already been moved to the site's outtakes folder was deleted altogether for its harsh stereotyping of fan convention attendees).

<ul><li> Season 1, episode 3 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/Tanis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/Tanis">TANIS</a></em> refers to the real-life case of Elisa Lam, who drowned in a hotel's water tower under mysterious circumstances. The podcast presents a fictional conspiracy theory that Lam had been possessed by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalTimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalTimeTravel">future-flung</a> Aleister Crowley. After outcry from the listeners, the episode was re-released with all instances of Lam's name bleeped. However, it's still obvious who's being discussed, what with the infamy of the case and references to Crowley writing about a historical figure named Siela (pointed out as an anagram of "BLEEP") and contacting an alien named Lam (not bleeped).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em> justified airing on MTV by using then-current songs as interstitial music; however, the rights issues put off a DVD release for a decade, at which point it was finally released with almost all of those songs removed. The box actually contains a little note from creator Glenn Eichler commenting on this, noting that while season one Daria would disapprove, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">season five Daria would say to shut up and pass the popcorn</a>.
<ul><li> The DVD also unfortunately has an edited version of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Is It College Yet?</a>" In particular, this version takes out some scenes that help set up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Daria and Tom's breakup</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Pixar short <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KnickKnack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KnickKnack">Knick Knack</a> had one of these. In the original 1989 version, the character models for Sunny Miami and Sunny Atlantis have very large breasts. In the 2003 release and onward, they both have significantly smaller breasts. Their new bras are also less revealing.
<ul><li> If you look closely at the 1989 version, you can see Sunny Miami's bra does not extend to her back. It does in the 2003 version
</li><li> This wasn't the idea of Disney, but of the original creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PixarRegulars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PixarRegulars">John Lasseter</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In "Space Pilot 3000," the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>, a man using the New New York tube system originally requested "JFK Jr. Airport" as his destination, an obvious joke on the real NYC's JFK International Airport. A few months later, the real JFK Jr. died in a plane crash; subsequent U.S. airings changed the line to a different parody of an NYC location, "Radio City <em>Mutant</em> Hall".
<ul><li> A quick gag in "The Cryonic Woman" had Bender applying for a job using the career chip embedded in a severed human arm, which when scanned reads "Prime Minister of Norway." Following terrorist attacks in Norway in 2011, reruns on Comedy Central and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SyFy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SyFy">Sy Fy</a>, as well as (eventually) the streaming version on Netflix and later Hulu, used an edited cut where the career was indicated as "Chainsaw Juggler." Cartoon Network's reruns left the joke intact.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a> known affectionately among fans as Derpy was given a scene which not only made her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon">Ascended Fanon</a> but also gave her a speaking line. However, due to the voice actress thinking Derpy was male, she was given a deep voice which, given Derpy's role as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">The Ditz</a> and the implications of her name, sounded like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpletonVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpletonVoice">Simpleton Voice</a>. This resulted in complaints from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> who claimed that "derpy" was pejorative and insensitive to people with disabilities. In order to avoid continued controversy, the episode became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">Missing Episode</a> for a while, and when it returned to iTunes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscoveryFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscoveryFamily">The Hub</a>, she was given a voice with less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalDissonance">Vocal Dissonance</a> and the line referring to her as "Derpy" was edited to take out the name (though The Hub's closed captioning wasn't updated to reflect the change). Many fans weren't happy, but episode writer Amy Keating Rogers later <a class="urllink" href="http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/amy-keating-rogers-response-to-derpy.html">explained why it had to happen<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> It's worth mentioning that those who bought and downloaded the episode from iTunes early on (for example, those with a Season Pass) have the original version of the episode. Those who have the <em>Friendship Express</em> DVD also have the original version.
</li></ul></li><li> The first airing of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode "The Mystery of the Urinal Deuce" gave <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">George W. Bush</a> a fairly "generic" accent; within a few days, reairings had redubbed him with something closer to his real-life Southern accent.
</li><li> In the original airing of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries">Superman: The Animated Series</a></em> episode "Apokolips...Now! (Part 2)," <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee">Stan Lee</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NickFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NickFury">Nick Fury</a> could all be seen at Dan Turpin's funeral, with the cameos meant as an homage to the deceased <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby">Jack Kirby</a>. For legal reasons, the cameos were all removed for the DVD release and subsequent airings.
</li><li> In the original cut of the 1933 Disney short, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheThreeLittlePigs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheThreeLittlePigs">The Three Little Pigs</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigBadWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigBadWolf">The Big Bad Wolf</a> attempts to trick the pigs into letting him into the brick house by disguising himself as a stereotypical immigrant Jewish peddler, complete with skullcap, beard and exaggeratedly big nose. In 1948, the studio reanimated the scene so that the wolf was now disguised as a Fuller brush salesman. However, he still had a Yiddish accent. In subsequent prints, especially for TV, the audio was overdubbed to give him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpletonVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpletonVoice">generic "dumb guy" voice</a>.
</li><li> In the original airing of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> episode "Team Homer", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Homer is shown having somehow stolen the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor given to Dr. Haing S.

In syndication and on the season seven DVD set, the scene was changed to show the Oscar being the one given to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonAmeche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonAmeche">Don Ameche</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cocoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cocoon">Cocoon</a></em>, who had died a few years earlier, but of natural causes.
</li><li> The first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhateverHappenedToRobotJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhateverHappenedToRobotJones">Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones?</a></em> gave the titular character a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SyntheticVoiceActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SyntheticVoiceActor">Synthetic Voice Actor</a>. In later episodes, he is voiced by a human voice actor named Bobby Block. Re-runs of the early episodes had his dialogue re-recorded with Block's voice.

<ul><li> The original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/PiratesOfTheCaribbean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/PiratesOfTheCaribbean">Pirates of the Caribbean</a> ride at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/DisneyThemeParks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/DisneyThemeParks">Disney Theme Parks</a> was refurbished to include characters from the film adaptations, and even rerecorded dialogue for several of the ride's original characters referencing Jack Sparrow. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Fan reaction was mixed</a>. Many years prior to the movie, the ride was altered to give all the women being chased by the pirates plates full of food — to tone down the implications of the scene by attempting to provide a G-rated motive for the pursuit (they're just trying to steal the food! And the women are trying to prevent them from stealing the food! that's all).
</li><li> It's been said, in fact, that one of Walt's motivations for building Disneyland in the first place was that he regretted not being able to change his movies after they were released, but a theme park has lots of opportunities for renovations. Whether he meant that recalling and re-editing his films would have been financially unfeasible when he had new movies that needed work on, or that ethically he just couldn't bring himself to do it, is uncertain.
</li><li> There are a few rather infamous images from the USSR featuring <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_images_in_the_Soviet_Union">Stalin and others<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>... then fewer and fewer 'others' as those people (or the nations they hailed from) fell out of favor, until only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Josef Stalin</a> remained.
</li><li> When Orwell worked for the BBC he had trouble keeping up with shifting alliances. First the Soviets were neutral towards The Allies and against Germany &amp; Japan (Second Sino-Japanese War), then neutral with Germany &amp; Japan and against The Allies early in World War 2 (Molotov-Ribbentrop Non-Aggression Pact), then against Germany and neutral with Japan and allied with The Allies (Soviet-German War, Soviet-Japanese Non-Aggression Pact), and then against Japan for the last month of the war. And <em>then</em> the Soviets were against The Allies again as the Cold War sank in. Further complicating matters, every one of Germany's European allies (Italy, Romania, Hungary, Finland, etc) also <em>fought on both sides</em>. Each and every time propaganda in the concerned countries had to change tack, sometimes drastically.
</li><li> This is a possible explanation (besides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories">Fake Memories</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse">The Multiverse</a>) for the <a class="urllink" href="https://infogalactic.com/info/Mandela_Effect">Mandela Effect<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. But it requires a fair amount of belief, because the level of organization is far beyond what is considered normal (think Eastern Europe during Soviet times). In order for this explanation to work, essentially <strong>every</strong> copy of <em>Berenstein Bears</em> everywhere needs to be replaced with <em>Berenstain Bears</em>. While this plays out easily when there are few copies, as in the picture of Stalin and Nikolai Yezhov, replacing hundreds of thousands of copies of a written work is another matter.
