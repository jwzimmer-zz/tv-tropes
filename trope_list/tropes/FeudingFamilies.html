When this happens on a large scale, we have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarTropes">war</a>. When it happens on a more private scale, between two family groups, we have the blood feud or vendetta.
</p><p>If the families of the first perpetrator and victim are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan">large enough</a> and roughly equal in power and resources, this can go on for a long, long time. So long, in fact, that it's rather easy for them to forget what the original cause of their fighting was. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily">A feud usually doesn't help the mental health of the individuals or the wisdom of their family culture.</a> This can lead to three most obvious conclusions:
</p><ol><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyExtermination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyExtermination">The near extinction of one or both warring families</a>. Feuding clans usually start with picking out the men of their opponents. When they begin to kill the women and children too, that's the sign that things are headed straight to hell and there will be no reconciliation. Other <em>seriously</em> bad signs are if the families engage in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy">Revenge by Proxy</a> or visit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinsOfOurFathers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinsOfOurFathers">Sins of Our Fathers</a> upon their children.
</li><li> One family yields and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMigration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMigration">flees the area.</a> This rarely happens, because people are stubborn like that and it's also anticlimactic. Plus, the other family might just pursue them to finish the job, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveDecay">even if they started the feud to get them to leave in the first place</a>.
</li><li> They make peace. Sometimes they even intermarry to strengthen their arrangement, a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarDiplomacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarDiplomacy">Altar Diplomacy</a>. This has been known to happen in real life, surprisingly enough. In real life, there was also a practice to pay blood money to appease the family of the dead and end this vicious cycle. This rarely happens in fiction, though.

</p><p>This scenario offers possibilities to explore all these themes, like the cause of war and peace, hate and forgiveness, right and wrong, and family loyalty. Following <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></em>, there will often be a pair of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">Star-Crossed Lovers</a> kept apart by the feud.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostHound">Ghost Hound</a></em>, the main and branch family, Komori and Ogami respectively, are at odds with one another, silently feuding despite two different generations trying to bring them together. Makoto and Tarou eventually overcome this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>: The Senju and Uchiha clans were constant rivals during the Warring Clans Era, often seeking employment in conflicts simply to oppose one another. Eventually both clans grew tired of the bloodshed and formed an alliance, which led to the founding of the Hidden Leaf Village and the end of open conflict between the two. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Due to Madara's actions and the inherited distrust of the Uchiha, the Senju used their dominance in Konoha to effectively muzzle their rivals. The resulting discontent led to the Uchiha planning a coup, which resulted in the Uchiha being wiped out by one of their own in an attempt to prevent a full-blown civil war. Ironically enough, the Senju themselves are implied to have already been all-but-extinct by the time the attempted coup was to take place</span>.
<ul><li> The origin of their feud is interesting in that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it began when the two sons of the Sage of Six Paths fought over who was their father's rightful successor. The eldest and disinherited son was forefather to the Uchiha, and the favored younger son was forefather to the Senju</span>.
</li><li> Tobi states that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Naruto</span>, being a relative of the Senju, is destined to battle with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sasuke</span>, an Uchiha. In the end the two fight <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to a draw, and in the aftermath they manage to make peace with each other, bringing the feud to a close</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Basilisk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Basilisk">Basilisk</a></em> has two feuding ninja clans who had been in a tense peace, until given a reason to engage in open warfare. And anyone who didn't have a personal reason before, gets one.
</li><li> The Tennos and Sanzenin families of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em> are said to have this kind of a relationship, hinted at being a rivalry of fortunes. What with only one person of child-bearing age each and both of them after the same guy, it's likely one of the families will die out, if not both.
</li><li> The title characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir">Noir</a></em> end up taking a contract on an ex-KGB officer who had ordered genocidal purges on a specific ethnic group some decades before. It turned out that this particular incident was just the last atrocity committed between that ethnic group and the officer's ethnic group in a feud that had been going on for centuries. The ultimate cause of this feud was never mentioned.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WildRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WildRock">Wild Rock</a></em>, although they avoid bloodshed, the lake clan and the forest clan have tense relations because their natural hunting grounds overlap. Thanks to Emba's prowess the forest clan is not getting much meat at all, hence Yuuen gets sent on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoneyTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoneyTrap">Honey Trap</a> mission to convince Emba to give him some of his catch. In the end Yuuen's and Emba's genuine feelings for each other lead to the clans setting aside their rivalry and uniting, and Yuuen's and Emba's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleInLawMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleInLawMarriage">siblings get married</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InitialD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InitialD">Initial D</a></em> has a race between Fujiwara Takumi and Kogashiwa Kai, whose fathers (Fujiwara Bunta and Kogashiwa Ken) had raced each other years ago.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>: A few generations removed, but this is what happens to Goku's great, great, great-grandson and Vegeta's great, great, great-grandson, who meet for the first time in a martial arts tournament and both have inherited their ancestors love of battle.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts">PandoraHearts</a></em>, the Nightray dukedom resents the Vessalius dukedom through a century of grudges and being put in their shadow. Interestingly, the Vessaliuses don't seem to have any negative feelings towards the Nightrays, and Oz Vessalius and Gilbert Nightray adore each other. Oz also had an excellent friendship with Elliot Nightray <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">before the latter died</span>, and they had wanted to fix the rift that had been created between their families.
</li><li> Chapter 168 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em> reveals the moderate Shinomiyas formed the Shijo family when they were exiled from the Shinomiyas because of their distaste for the main families' unsavory business practices. The Shinomiyas have done all they can to interfere with the Shijos since then, forcing the Shijos to move their business overseas. In the modern day both families see each other as enemies to crush to the point Maki even states the Shijos are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfHate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfHate">driven to succeed because of their grudge</a>.

The feud spans centuries, and comes from the hate Malcolm Thawne has for his biological brother, Barry Allen (the second Flash), who got to grow up happy with their biological parents while Malcolm was raised by criminals. Bart Allen (Impulse/Kid Flash II) is an heir to both, and aware of it, but doesn't angst over his lineage like most other people (he doesn't really think or talk about it unless you insist on pressing the issue) and practically laughs at Zoom's "corrupted bloodline" rant.

</li><li> A good part of <em>Les Maîtres de l'Orge</em> revolves around the feud between two dynasties of brewers, the Steenforts and the Texels; however, while the feud is set up from the first tome, the Texels then relocate to America, and the Steenforts who remained in their native Belgium and focus more on the European market don't feel its full weight until the fifth tome, when Karl Texel threatens to take control of Steenfort Breweries. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The next tome ends with Christopher Texel, a.k.a.

It stems from the contempt that Hawkman (Carter Hall and Katar Hol) and Green Arrow (Oliver Queen) have for each other, given Hawkman's conservative, even fascistic, worldview conflicting with Green Arrow's liberalism. Roy Harper (Speedy/Arsenal/Red Arrow, the former sidekick to Ollie) even invokes it when someone warns him away from Kendra Saunders (Hawkgirl), a Hawkgirl who <em>doesn't</em> have her past self's memories. Writer Brad Meltzer even intentionally invokes Romeo and Juliet when it comes to the two.

<ul><li> The Starks and Lannisters. The only reason they are civil to each other is because Ned Stark's best friend Robert Baratheon married into the Lannister family. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">But once Robert dies (and it's strongly hinted that his wife Cersei killed him so her bastards who she passes off as Robert's children could succeed), all bets are off and the Lannisters utterly devastate the Starks, though not without suffering some losses themselves.</span> It's worth noting that Martin based this feud lightly on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfTheRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfTheRoses">Wars of the Roses</a>.
<ul><li> Though this feud is relatively recent, occurring because Lord Eddard Stark was outraged at the Lannisters' treacherous actions during Robert's Rebellion, sacking King's Landing and murdering all the Targaryens they could find, even though he was at war with the Targaryens.
</li></ul></li><li> A more civil example exists between Houses Tyrell and Martell; while not openly hostile towards each other like the Starks and Lannisters, they have a long enmity dating back centuries that they're still not entirely over today. They mostly get by using passive-aggressive digs at each other and giving whoever's in charge of dealing with them when they're in the same place a headache. A notable exception is Willas Tyrell and Oberyn Martell, who are pen pals and get along nicely, despite being the pretext for the current generation's mutual hatred; Oberyn crippled Willas in a tournament, and even though it was a fair match and a complete accident caused largely by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy">Non-Action Guy</a> Willas being in a fight he had no business being in, the only Tyrell <em>not</em> to blame Oberyn (and thus the entire Martell family) is Willas himself.
</li><li> There's also a lot of bad blood between House Lannister and House Martell, as during the Sack of King's Landing, Tywin Lannister sent his bannermen to kill Rhaegar Targaryen's children in order to make it easier for Robert Baratheon to take the throne. Said bannermen, Gregor Clegane and Amory Lorch, not only brutally slaughtered the children, but Clegane also raped and murdered their mother Elia Martell—the sister of the current Prince of Dorne. Prince Doran and Oberyn naturally didn't take this too well <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and it gradually emerges that they conspired to return Viserys Targaryen to the throne and take their revenge for Elia and her children. Even after the Viserys plot falls through, thanks to that pot of molten gold, the Martells are still determined to make the Lannisters <em>pay.</em> When Oberyn dies fighting Gregor, his bastard daughters the Sand Snakes swear vengeance and want Dorne to declare war on the Iron Throne. Doran calms them down, and puts them to work on his more subtle plans.</span>
</li><li> Riverlands families Bracken and Blackwood <em>loathe</em> each other, to the point that Lord Tytos Blackwood refuses to surrender despite his castle being his side's last remaining stronghold in a war, because it means he'll be surrendering to the Brackens. When Jaime Lannister comes along and offers more amicable terms, he's quick to surrender. While there Jaime inquires why the two families have never tried to make peace, and it turns out they have made peace dozens of times and are so intermarried every Blackwood has a Bracken ancestor, and visa versa. Eventually the people who made the peace die, and something reinvigorates the feud. The Bracken-Blackwood feud had wider-reaching consequences for the realm, and may have helped to fuel the first Blackfyre Rebellion.
<ul><li> This feud stretches back for centuries, back to the pre-Conquest days when kings ruled over the Riverlands, although one dynasty of Riverlands kings (House Justman) was actually founded by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard">Heroic Bastard</a> whose parents were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">Star-Crossed Lovers</a> from the two families.
</li></ul></li><li> Although initially rather one-sided, the Freys have loathed their titular overlords the Tullys for quite a while and stalled them wherever feasible using mainly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassiveAggressiveKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassiveAggressiveKombat">Passive-Aggressive Kombat</a> of various kinds and ducking behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlausibleDeniability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlausibleDeniability">Plausible Deniability</a> whenever possible without actively breaking their connections. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They ramp their end of the feud up by several orders of magnitude thanks to the Red Wedding, so it actually becomes this trope good and hard with any surviving (or undead) Tully and their allies quite motivated to join in. As many Northmen and Rivermen were murdered, the Freys are surrounded by people who want them dead, and for breaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality">Sacred Hospitality</a> most of the Seven Kingdoms, even their allies, despise them.</span> Ironically enough, there are numerous feuds within House Frey due to how large and unpleasant the House is, with Walder Frey's many descendants jockeying for favour and the implication numerous members are quite willing to murder their way up the line of succession.
</li><li> The Manderlys and the Peakes of the Reach feuded until the former were defeated and fled to the North, at which point the Peakes were given their abandoned castles. This stemmed from a dispute between 2 historical Lords Manderly and Peake over which of their wives would inherit the throne of the Reach from their father the king, who had no sons. After a war during which the Dornish invaded, sacked the king's castle, and killed the king, a coalition led by the Tyrells ended the dispute by ignoring the feuding lords and crowning a distant cousin as king.

They hate each other's guts and are often literally at each other's throats if given time. This animosity goes so far that if one of them joins a large faction like the Grand Alliance, the other will automatically oppose the alliance even if it means siding with a faction they would normally consider their enemy.

Feud is required for houses to attack one another on planets under imperial jurisdiction and is expended with every successful assault. It's not unknown for players to intentionally insult one another so the mechanical feud can persist as long as the RP one.

One family is descended from a British spy who stole the real Declaration of Independence while the other family is descended from the American Minuteman tasked with retrieving it (not knowing that he was sent on a suicide mission by his superiors to keep him from revealing the truth while they copied the Declaration).

It was the inspiration for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke">Lucky Luke</a> album <em>The Rivals of Painful Gulch</em>.
</li><li> More <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>: The Pazzi family and the Medici family of Renaissance Florence, Italy. The former is famous for their botched assassination attempt on Lorenzo and Guiliano de' Medici on April 26, 1478 after High Mass on the steps of the Duomo. To be fair to the Pazzi family, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope">The Pope</a> didn't like the Medicis either. Not many people did, except the people of Florence.
<ul><li> And thus, the inspiration for the first arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII">Assassin's Creed II</a></em>. The main character is on the Medicis' side, but that has less to do with any personal attachment to them and more to do with his part in a way <em>bigger</em> feud: the Assassins vs the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">Templars</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfTheRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfTheRoses">Wars of the Roses</a>, with House York and House Lancaster. It started in 1455, due to the fallout from the English defeat in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHundredYearsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHundredYearsWar">The Hundred Years War</a> and the declining mental state of Henry VI. Because he came to the throne as an infant, and never became a forceful leader, the nobility descended from different sons of Edward III grew in power and ambition. This was complicated by the fact that Henry's grandfather, Henry IV, was a usurper, and one without an ironclad claim to the throne, from a certain perspective the Yorkist claim to the throne was actually better then Henry VI's claim.
<ul><li> And the situation was <em>even more</em> complicated with the Neville-Percy feud. The war between the two Plantagenet branches provided a neat way to resolve matters with cold steel by Nevilles and Percys on both sides.
</li></ul></li><li> The German branches of the House of Welfs and the House of Hohenstaufen in the 12th century. Not even marriage between them could end it, though both families were much too large and powerful to actually die out from a mere feud.
<ul><li> Which led into three centuries of civil wars between Guelphs (Welf supporters, usually Papal) and Ghibellini (Hohenstaufen supporters, usually Imperial) in Italy.
</li><li> In the second half of the 19th century the House of Welf got into a feud with the House of Hohenzollern after The Kingdom of Prussia (under the Hohenzollerns) annexed the Kingdom of Hannover and drove the Welfs in exile in Austria. This feud was resolved in the classical way in 1912, when the last surviving son of the head of the Welfs met and fell in love with the only daughter of the head of the Hohenzollern family.
</li></ul></li><li> The Japanese have had a bunch of these. Several of which led to country wide civil wars. Most famously the Gempei war between the Taira (Heike) and the Minamoto (Genji) clans.
</li><li> The Vikings of the Scandinavian lands were infamous for this. They would always fight each other for even the smallest things. The only thing that would make temporary truces was to invade England or France. It was only when Christianity came to the northern lands, and then the Viking chieftains took inspiration from the feudal systems in the mainland and reformed their turfs into united kingdoms, that the feudings ended.
<ul><li> or at least grew in scale due to the centralizing nature of the church. For much of the Scandinavian middle age violent murder and civil strife played an important part in the royal succession. Denmark and Sweden are also among the top contenders for the title of most wars fought between the same countries.
</li></ul></li><li> In several Italian city-states one of the requirements of citizenship was to forswear vengeance as that supposedly now belonged to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment">The Government</a> which was supposed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral">dispense it impartially</a>. The fact that that had to be made explicit reveals a number of things about Medieval Italian culture.
</li><li> Unfortunately, very much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> amongst the Gypsy (Roma and Sinti) nations. The one reason why the Nazis almost managed to exterminate those two nation for good during the WWII was that various Sinti and Roma families were unable to co-operate due to centuries of family feuds.
</li><li> In Korea, the Shims and the Yooms. The feud started in the mid 1700's and went on for about 250 years.
</li><li> A more lighthearted version of this is from many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships">British regiments</a>. The British military system still maintains traces of the eighteenth century <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">warrior fraternity</a> air in an age of heavily bureaucratized warfare. Several regiments are traditional "enemies" and will continue their feuds with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PracticalJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PracticalJoke">practical jokes</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarBrawl">bar brawls</a>.
</li><li> Similar ritual feuds have been noted by anthropologists among low-tech cultures. As lethal weapons are sometimes used the proportion of ritual and the proportion of feud is debatable and in any case probably depends on the nature of the dispute.
</li><li> Oddly enough <em>potential</em> feuding does have a positive (or at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteTheRightThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteTheRightThing">less negative</a>) side effect in serving as a substitute for military and constabulary deterrence in places where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment">The Government</a> is weak. In such places a common custom is to pay blood-money for cross-tribal offenses weighted at the economic or political value of the person injured. This provides a face-saver that allows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePatriarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePatriarch">The Patriarchs</a> of a given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan">clan</a> to settle the dispute without a feud, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProveIAmNotBluffing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProveIAmNotBluffing">threat of feud</a> remains a feature of local politics.
</li><li> The Bavarian town of Herzogenaurach, located about 15 miles northwest of Nuremberg, is today considered one of the greatest laboratories for sociologists thanks to a local family feud that has since expanded to ridiculous proportions. It all started in 1924 when hometown boys Adolf "Adi" Dassler and his brother Rudolf opened an athletic shoe company which is today known as Puma. The Dasslers achieved worldwide fame when Jesse Owens ran in their shoes when he won several gold medals at the 1936 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames">Olympic Games</a>. But the Dassler boys - the biggest employers in town - hated each others' guts, and their hatred for each other only grew worse during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. In 1948, the brothers announced to their workers that their hatred for each other had reached an irreconcilable point and that Adi was leaving to open a rival company  Adidas - on the other side of town, across the Aurach River. The employees then started choosing sides. After a quarter century, most of the people in town had relocated themselves to the side of the river that corresponded with whichever company they favored. Now the town - which had been united for over 900 years  is like a house shared by two pissed-off divorcees who refuse to move out after everything else has been settled. Except that instead of two people, there are about 24,000 people. Today, each side of the river has its own businesses, athletic teams, schools, etc. And if you wear Pumas on the Adidas side of the river, or vice versa, you probably won't get served at local businesses, you probably will be heckled, and you may be assaulted.
</li><li> The clans of Scotland were known for this for a long time, though it died down after the country's acquisition by the United Kingdom, which served to unite many of them to rebel against a perceived common enemy.
</li><li> Clan warfare was similarly common in Ireland and Wales, and it allowed the English to divide the countries against themselves.
<ul><li> Not, however, the MacDonalds and Campbells, whose feud fed into the Jacobite wars, and was maintained into modern times by the Gordon and Argyll Highlander regiments of the British army.
</li><li> The border clans also, as depicted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeMacDonaldFraser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeMacDonaldFraser">George MacDonald Fraser</a>'s history of the border reavers.
</li></ul></li><li> Armenia was chiefly ruled by wealthy families between 300 BC and 1045 AD in a similar way to Scotland, the heads of which were called nakharars. The families developed fierce rivalries with one another, but were mostly kept in check by a king or a conquering empire. The Mamikonians and Bagratunis particularly disliked one another, due to the Mamikonians liking to fight first and ask questions later, while the Bagratunis solved their problems diplomatically. Things got much worse though between the 800's and 1000's when the Bagratuni family was given its own kingdom by the Arabs. Rival nakharars decided to break away and form their own small kingdoms, and there was much in-fighting, making the whole area easy pickings for the Byzantine Empire and then the Seljuk Turks.
</li><li> The feud between the Habsburgs (also known as the House of Austria), rulers of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire">Holy Roman Empire</a> and Spain, and the Royal House of France (first the Valois, then the Bourbons, but both were branches of the same dynasty) which goes back at least to the Italian Wars of Charles V (Carlos I of Spain) and Francis I and went on for centuries despite frequent marriages between members of the two rival houses. Later, when nationalism arose, the "hereditary enmity" between the Habsburgs and their French rivals came to be reinterpreted as something between the French and German peoples.
</li><li> Also dating back to the 16th century, the rivalry between the Ernestine (elder) and Albertine (younger) branches of the House of Wettin. As Electors of Saxony, members of the Ernestine branch had supported Luther and the Reformation, which in a subsequent war led to them losing their Electoral title and their original lands to the Albertine branch and being forced to relocate to Thuringia, where they split into several lines, including the one that would later become the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha or Windsor. August the Strong, an Albertine Elector of Saxony, later converted to Catholicism in order to become king of Poland, as did his heirs, which added a religious note to the rivalry between the Ernstine and Albertine branches.
</li><li> Canada had its own feuds, especially the infamous one involving the notorious Donnelly family in Lucan, Ontario. That conflict involved that family against most of the surrounding community that got so bitter that it ultimately ended with a bloody home invasion/massacre of the Donnellys.
</li><li> The Figueres family and the Calderón family in Costa Rica, thankfully after the short but bloody civil war in 1948 when each of the families' patriarch lead a different enemy faction of the war, their rivalry became exclusively political.
</li><li> Romanovs and Ulyanovs in Russia. As the Czarist regime sentenced Alexander Ulyanov on murder attempt against Czar Alexander III, the elder brother of Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (Lenin) to death, Vladimir swore revenge to the whole Imperial family. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RussianRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RussianRevolution">rose in power in 1917</a>, and wasted no time on exterminating not only Czar Nicholas II and his family, but most of the Romanovs. A chain of vendetta was prevented only by the family line of Ulyanov going extinct first.
</li><li> The Trịnh and Nguyễn lords divided Vietnam into two because of this, with a helping of courtly intrigue. At first they both claimed to be vassals of the Later Lê dynasty intent on defeating the Mạc usurpers, but utilized this to increase their influence and land. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarDiplomacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarDiplomacy">Altar Diplomacy</a> was tried <em>before</em> war officially broke out (and it was an aunt-in-law/nephew-in-law marriage to boot). They fought for 46 years, then gave up, and managed to have 100 years of a peaceful ceasefire. Then the Tây Sơn rebellion (against a Nguyễn court that was infighting) happened. The Trịnh lords decided it was a good time to crush their enemies once and for all, and threw their support behind the rebellion, until Tây Sơn forces turned against them too. Tây Sơn land ended up making a barrier between the Trịnh and Nguyễn sides, so neither could advance to attack the other. The feud <em>finally</em> ended when the Nguyễn, taking advantage of the Trịnh resting on their laurels of having pushed their enemies into a tight corner, finally seized power and made themselves into a full-fledged dynasty.
