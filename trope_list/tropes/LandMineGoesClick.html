Hundreds of thousands of them lie buried and forgotten around the world. One of the most dangerous and easy to deploy weapons of war, they can effectively deny an area from use for any purpose until they're cleared. They were considered so dangerous in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> that the armies used special tanks equipped with massive rollers and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFlail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFlail">chain whips</a> to detonate them away from the tank's hull and clear a path through the field. Modern armies deploy everything from explosive counter-charges to remote-controlled robots to deal with the things.
</p><p>Thus, it's no surprise that mines turn up a lot in fiction. With any luck, they will be announced. But there is a major difference.
</p><p>In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, you probably won't know somebody stepped on a mine until they blow up.
</p><p>In fiction, however, the squad will hear a tiny "click" as someone steps on the first mine, and we will have a tense moment while their friends try to figure out how to get the poor guy off of it without killing him. This usually involves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeightAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeightAndSwitch">finding a nice big rock to hold the button down</a> while everybody runs for cover.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Another variant is to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Redshirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Redshirt">redshirt</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mook</a>, or an otherwise expendable character step on one and have it detonate immediately, killing them. This is often followed by the survivors getting down on their hands and knees and carefully making their way out, probing the ground ahead with sticks and knives (especially in war stories). This is derived from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> military training on how to extract yourself from a minefield - except the part about using knives (or anything made of steel/iron): some of the larger (antitank) mines have magnetic-proximity triggers.
</p><p>Very occasionally, you'll get both. It'll give an audible warning that it's been triggered, but that's no help to the victim — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveSecondForeshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveSecondForeshadowing">all he has time for</a> is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> reaction before he's pâté.
</p><p>Many video games feature land mines with <em>serious</em> design problems, so it's quick and easy for a single main character to avoid or disarm them, unlike in real life. Such land mines might even feature flashing lights and beep a few seconds before they go off, which rather defeats the purpose<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0r6uw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0r6uw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0r6uw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Sort of. Part of a Minefield's purpose is area denial, so if seeing the land mines makes you stay away or find a different path, they're still doing their job.</span>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>In reality, most personnel mines will go off whether or not you release the button. Which makes sense, if you consider that a pressure-release trigger would be more complicated and more prone to failure. Also, the only benefit from a mine following this trope is that a group of soldiers are delayed trying to help their friend. If the landmine simply blows the poor guy's leg off, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquad">The Squad</a> still has to tend to him, only now the explosion has tipped off any nearby defenders to intruders. That said, if the mine is a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouncing_Betty">Bouncing Betty<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the most effective thing to do is dive and duck immediately to receive minimum damage from the shrapnel, as it mainly spreads horizontally (at roughly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">crotch-height</a>, so even if it doesnt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTheManHeUsedToBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTheManHeUsedToBe">cut you in half</a>, you may end up wishing it did. Yikes).
</p><p>Also applies to all manner of similar explosive boobytraps involving pressure plates, trip wires and other triggering mechanisms.
</p><p>A recent variation is a 'claymore' or directional mine. Rather than just blow up and hope someone's over it, these consist of a mounting plate, the explosive charge, and the soon-to-be shrapnel. The charge is set up so that the explosion fans shrapnel out in an arc in front of the mine, similar to a shotgun blast, rather than a general disorganized kaboom. It is important that the right side is facing the enemy, thus American versions have a large 'FRONT - TOWARD ENEMY' label embossed on them. These are usually set off by either a tripwire or a wired remote-trigger (which really does go 'click') in the hands of someone a safe distance away from the mine - so chances are, surviving the blast still leaves you in a gunfight with whoever just decided to try and blow you up...
</p><p>Note that certain kind of land mines are now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar">prohibited by an international treaty</a> signed by many countries, notably not including the USA, Russia, China or India.

<ul><li> Once upon a time, a boy named Kuro Hazama and his mother were walking on a beach. They found a mine, the boy approached it and his mom tried to stop him... then it went BOOM, seriously injuring both of them. Mrs. Hazama died in the hospital, her child survived and became the greatest surgeon in the world, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack">Black Jack</a></em>.
<ul><li> In <em>Black Jack</em> 21, it is revealed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> this was done <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaterFamilicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaterFamilicide">intentionally by an evil organization his father was working with</a></span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/EdenItsAnEndlessWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/EdenItsAnEndlessWorld">Eden: It's an Endless World!</a></em> a military officer is clearing a newly mined road by forcing local villagers to walk through one by one. After a young girl steps on a mine and freezes, officer comments that she's smart, as mines only blow up when you step off. Then he shoots her in the leg to make her fall.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanicFumoffu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanicFumoffu">Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu</a></em> has a prime example of this. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotSpringsEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotSpringsEpisode">Hot Springs Episode</a>, when Kurz and the guys are trying to get peeks of the naked girls, one of them steps on a landmine planted by Sousuke. Kurz immediately throws himself to the ground and unearths the mine, and picking up a big rock, tells the would-be victim to slowly shift his foot as he slides the rock on the mine. The procedure is almost finished... When our victim sneezes. Naturally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> as everyone is sent flying.
<ul><li> Sousuke also answers a letter of challenge from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival">Tsubaki</a> by leaving a note pinned via combat knife to a tree explaining that he had a much more important mission to complete (i.e. stapling papers) and thus has left a "foot soldier" to battle in his place. The foot soldier in question? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTapeKnewYouWouldSayThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTapeKnewYouWouldSayThat">Why, the anti-personnel mine Tsubaki just stepped on while reading the letter, of course!</a> The letter then challenges Tsubaki to dismantle the mine with the provided combat knife. If he's successful, Tsubaki can consider himself the victor. He is not.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em> pulls this off in one episode. Due to a combination of corruption and ineffectual robbers, Chief Aramaki gets trapped in a hostage situation where the SWAT team would just as soon shoot everyone on sight. Capturing one of the would-be rescuers, he rigs a fake explosive device and props the unconscious guy on top of a "pressure sensor" to buy some time for escape; the mine is only noticed when they try to move the guy and the SWAT team pauses a while trying to disarm it. The strategy doesn't buy a lot of time but it does work.
</li><li> Used humorously in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em> - the Yorozuya and Shinsengumi team up to capture a panty-thief, bury landmines around the bait... and promptly forget where the mines are set. Explosive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HeavyObject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HeavyObject">Heavy Object</a></em>
<ul><li> Land mines are largely banned by international treaty but still make appearances. It's not uncommon for the protagonists to get sent out on mine sweeping duty.
</li><li> The Capitalist Enterprise military sometimes deploys the EX-Wall, a wire barrier laden with explosives. This does nothing to enemy Objects but if the barrier is damaged without being detonated the explosives are scattered and become impromptu land mines. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">The Enterprise can then accuse their enemy of the war crime of seeding mines</a>.
</li><li> Stalker Killer Unit was a black ops unit that specialized in transporting "paint", as in paint used to camouflage proximity mines. While extracting high value targets the Unit would seed the area with mines to delay pursuers.
</li><li> An oasis controlled by the Capitalist Enterprise is surrounded by a smart minefield. Actual mines are interspersed with duds to confuse detection while some mines are actually layered one on top of the other; if the top one is defused, the bottom one detonates. When an area's mines are depleted a rocket system air drops a new batch which bury themselves.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em> plays this completely straight, with the Wild Geese surrounding Hellsing Manor with mines to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> fend off the charging Nazi vampires.</span>

</li></ul></li><li> Played straight in the second episode of <em>Japan Sinks 2020</em>. The family is walking through a village when they see a sign on a fence warning people that digging Japanese yams is prohibited. The father immediately hops over the fence to dig some while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck">not noticing the signs warning about the unexploded ordnance in the area</a>. After he's dug a hole more than six feet deep, his daughter <em>finally</em> notices the warning sign, just in time for him to hit a mine with his shovel.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossZero">Macross Zero</a></em> demonstrates an odd if potentially realistic example. One character steps on a mine, only for career soldier Roy Fokker to notice just in time to tell her not to take another step. He then carefully digs away the dirt surrounding the mine and, over the course of several stressful minutes, disarms its detonator. He then proves himself to be a total jerk by pulling his companion into a kiss, to which she freaks out and demands how long the mine's been disarmed. "A while."

The sniper notices it, steps past it, and doesn't warn the colonel (rivalry in a war zone is a bitch). The colonel steps on it and pleads for help, but the sniper takes a glance, then tells him to remain still and keeps walking. A few seconds later, we hear the boom from the main character's POV. It was actually the colonel's fault. They knew they were in a minefield, but only the sniper was actually paying attention to where he was walking.

Franklin survives, courtesy of a phone call made by using his foot to dial 911 on the telephone that was just beyond his reach.
</li><li> There's also several other variations on this. In an early scene where the bomb disposal expert is teaching a class, Franklin is being overly cocky, so the instructor tells him to come up to the front of the class to demonstrate how to disarm a Bouncing Betty.

</li><li> The psychological thriller <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mine">Mine</a></em> uses this as its premise: the protagonist has stepped on a mine and must survive until help arrives - in the desert, alone, while remaining motionless, and uncertain whether help is in fact coming.

It turns out that the enemy soldier is still alive, but unconscious. Eventually, UN forces are more or less browbeaten into coming to help, only to have the munitions expert learn what kind of explosive it is, and say that he <em>can't</em> disable it. The browbeating is done by the press, so when they see a person being rapidly stretchered away they are annoyed with the anticlimactic ending and leave, not bothering to take one last look at the site. We see the wounded soldier left alone on the bomb to either die of his wounds, starve to death, or get up off the bomb and die. This film was, incidentally, presented in part as a comedy. Bosnians don't mess around with jokes.

Fortunately, Jedi can sense them wherever they're planted, and the Solo children and their friends make use of this to help clear out many fields and tunnels that have been seeded with these weapons. Flying low enough over a field with shields active also proves very effective for clearing out the burrowing detonators planted there.

A criminal had set up a pressure-sensitive plate as a trap; when Lt. Garfield stepped on it, a tape recording informed him he'd activated a bomb which would blow up in 60 seconds or when he stepped off, whichever came first. The Flash arrived just in time to take Garfield's place, then escape at super-speed once he was clear of the building.

While in Afghanistan, Harm and Mac end up wrecking their Humvee amidst a minefield, and Harm ends up stepping on the Hollywood click-and-wait variety of mine. Mac takes cover on the other side of the Humvee while Harm prepares to drop a weight on the mine and leap away, barely escaping in the process (along with landing on Mac in quite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> arrangement).

There's also a slight variation in one episode where Mac finds himself having to prop up a rickety shelf that's holding several cases of unstable old dynamite. If he lets go, he'll go boom.
<ul><li> And there was another episode where Murdoc was first introduced: Though the device wasn't explicitly called a mine, it worked on the Bouncing Betty principle. Mac sat down on his bed and that armed the bomb planted in it. Pete told him that it would only detonate when he got off the bed but the blast would be directed mainly upwards so if he jumped away fast enough he'd be safe. This is one of those serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> moments. If the bomb only explodes upwards and detonates only when you get off the bed... how is that supposed to kill you again?
</li><li> It would kill you because normally, your ass would still be lingering above the mattress for a brief second while you are standing up. The blast could very well incinerate your behind and leave you bleeding to death.
</li><li> Yet another one took place in a snowy cave in which all Mac had to do was dig the snow out from the side and shove a metal bar into conveniently sized holes to stop the "platform" from springing up.

Their flawed guidance unfortunately leaves him stranded holding the child with (untripped) mines six inches from him on all sides, requiring a helicopter to pick them up and lift them directly out of the field (even though in real life, this would be inadvisable, as the downward pressure from the helicopter may very well set off mines. The best way to get out of a minefield is the hard, slow way).
<ul><li> "And now you're in the middle of downtown Berlin!"
</li><li> A later one showed a farmer using his daughters to clear a minefield. It goes wrong, of course. Radar runs over to the stricken girl and carries her to safety, and then is reminded that he ran through an unmarked but recently verified minefield.

For some reason, the projection is physical until he chooses to get back to his own body, at which point it disappears. He uses this trick to lure the titular hero to a rooftop where he has set up a pressure-sensitive mine. He gets Night Man to step on it, smiles, and fades away. Then Night Man fades away. Turns out he used one of his handy gadgets to create a hologram. It's not entirely clear how a hologram could have triggered a pressure sensor.
</li><li> Seen twice in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePretender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePretender">The Pretender</a></em>. In the Vietnam War, a US soldier is looking for a mole in the jungle when he and his guide hears a click. His guide, a young boy, had his foot on the mine and the soldier knew he wouldn't last long so she was able to switch his foot with the boy's by carefully shifting the boy's foot off and his on to keep constant pressure. It worked. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then the mole shows up, knowing the soldier could stand there until people came looking shoots the guy from a distance and framed him as the mole.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Primeval" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Primeval">Primeval</a></em> has a whole <em>minefield</em>. Unusually for this trope, they actually notice the minefield a while before using it to blow up a phorusrhacid.

No clicking, but it played this trope straight in that the swollen acid-sacs in the roots made icky squelching noises prior to cutting loose with their spray. The gag of someone obliviously walking right through the field without being harmed was also used.
</li><li> The better part of an episode of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheUnit">The Unit</a></em> is spent in a minefield the characters and the diplomatic workers they were evacuating wander into.

When a German soldier steps on a mine while on patrol, the rest of his unit has time to evacuate before it blows up. Immediately afterwards, however, when the surviving Germans force local civilians to walk in front of them through the minefield, any mines the peasants step on go off immediately.

The example playing the trope the straightest are probably "vibrabombs", which can <em>only</em> be set off by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">BattleMechs</a> because their triggers are sensitive to the specific vibrations caused by their steps, and are even set to ignore 'Mechs lighter than a desired target weight, though this will cause 'Mechs that are heavier than the target weight to set them off prematurely, making their use highly situational.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CarWars">Car Wars</a></em> featured these in two main flavors, normal and 'Spear 1000', which primarily shot up rather than spread out. Both were primarily meant to take down the titular cars and similar; walking through a mine counter was perfectly safe. Splatbooks of course offered antipersonnel mines, as well as the minesweeper mentioned above that can get mounted on a convenient tank.
</li><li> These were given their own sidebar in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Cyberpunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Cyberpunk">Cyberpunk</a> 2020</em>, referring to sneaky things you can do.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">Mage: The Awakening</a></em>, mixing wards with other spells fill the magical role of "land mines". Since they DON'T actually go "click", a clever mage expecting more than one foe will set the condition for "when an enemy leaves the area" rather than "when an enemy enters the area" in order to try to peg the lot at once with the requisite magical nastiness. Since the people most capable of detecting those kinds of traps tend to not be the bruisers at the front of the battle-line, it's not uncommon for the technical mage to notice the ward only after it's been "primed", leading to the famous "hold down the button" situation.
<ul><li> Which, since the idea is usually "slow enemies down while you run away" in Mage, is actually a better result than the spell going off from the trap-layer's perspective. Every minute dedicated to figuring out your spell and unraveling it is a minute you can spend jumping out a window and dashing madly for the car.

<ul><li> These mines are aversions in that they do not beep, click, or hesitate before detonating. Mercifully they are not buried and can usually be survived, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">but hide well in even moderately tall grass and can be destroyed with weapons fire</a>.

Since their power and conspicuousness applies to AI too, placing a mine will most often lead to a guard spotting you planting something and running over to shove you, detonating the just-planted mine and severely injuring you both.
</li><li> Very much averted in the multiplayer shootout modes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoTooie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoTooie">Banjo-Tooie</a></em>. The landmines are a dark grey, rather small, don't make noise, don't give off any warnings or lights, and they can instantly kill you. Oh, and just like in real life, they're equal opportunity weapons; they'll explode for anybody who gets too close, so you'd better remember where you put all those mines!
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock">BioShock</a></em> series has Proximity Mines that can be launched from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeLauncher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeLauncher">Grenade Launcher</a>, with obvious pulsing red lights, and which also explode on contact like normal grenades, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StickyBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StickyBomb">sticking onto walls</a>.

It can be lobbed or dropped on the ground like any other TNT bomb, and once it stops moving it'll emit a beep after about one second; after this, if anything that gets close to it, it'll clack loudly and explode less than a second afterwards. They'll explode immediately if shot by a hitscan weapon or caught in an explosion. Sometimes already-armed ones are placed in levels as a trap.

<ul><li> Earlier Call of Duty games enforced map boundaries with minefields; if you got a little too adventurous, you'd have less than a second after the "click" to jump back to safety. And not even that in <em>2</em>.
</li><li> Then there's the Bouncing Betty ambush in Modern Warfare 2- the game actually enforces the "go low to avoid the shrapnel" rule.

<ul><li> It's a subversion in <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em>, seeing as how your only warning is a <em>SPROING!</em> when the mine goes off (at which point, it is too late). Quite annoying, since the game has mine LAYERS, but not mine DETECTORS.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerGenerals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerGenerals">Command &amp; Conquer: Generals</a></em>, the Chinese can equip every structure with hidden (for enemies) land mines and neutron mines (in <em>Zero Hour</em>), which kill infantry, even in vehicles, which you then can proceed to capture. They can also airdrop minefields. Likewise, GLA demo traps are hidden barrels with proximity sensors and an explosive payload powerful enough to take out a tank, that stay cloaked until they're interacted with; for an extra mean kick in multiplayer, the player can set it to manual mode and detonate it that way. They take a second to bleep a very unpleasant sound and then proceed to explode, taking out anything that isn't very fast and just cruising past it like a Technical or Combat Cycle. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkerUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkerUnit">Worker Units</a> can disable mines, and in <em>Zero Hour</em>, Demo Traps as well; the latter can also be revealed like any cloaked unit and shot until it detonates, and they even yield experience to the unit that deals the last shot.

However, triggering a sequencer charge mine had the stereotypical short beeps, followed by a massive explosion. Most curious, however, was the I.M. mine from the first game, because those things actually had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundCodedForYourConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundCodedForYourConvenience">distinctive ringing chime when triggered that sounded like nothing else in the game</a>. It was a handy way to know you had about a second to figure out which was the right direction to run if you wanted to take only a tenth of your health in damage versus being blown to Tatooine.

The Sisters of Battle combine this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">Kill It with Fire</a> by deploying powerful incendiary mines.
<ul><li> What makes them more destructive is that most detecting units default to close combat for attacking. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">And they don't make an exception for minefields.</a>

They still constantly flash a color appropriate the type of mine and beep faintly, though, and it's possible to get up close enough to disarm them and pick them up by moving <em><strong>very</strong></em> slowly (you have to crouch <em>and</em> switch to walking instead of running). Also, you can set off your own mines (which are made by sticking a grenade into a mine template), which are activated a couple seconds after being set.

Justified as he's using them to ward off large creatures from an area and it wouldn't be any good for humans to accidentally blunder into the kill zone.
</li><li> The mines in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> "beep", instead of "click", giving the player just enough time to either try and disarm them or get the heck off. Disarming mines does make them go "click" though.
<ul><li> The longest mission in the game ("The Wasteland Survival Guide") has a segment where you go to an entire <em>town</em> filled with landmines and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto">explosive cars</a>, and a man is shooting at you with a sniper rifle in an attempt to get you to kill yourself spectacularly. The entire area seems to be a meta-reference to Hideo Kojima games, coincidentally.
</li><li> <em>Fallout 3</em> offers four types of mines: basic frag mines, stronger plasma mines, and anti-electronic pulse mines, The home-built bottlecap mines are technically <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised_explosive_device">IEDs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> but they are massively powerful. As an amusing example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCrueltyPotential">Videogame Cruelty Potential</a>, you can arm a mine and put it into your opponent's inventory for a quick and clean kill (clean, as in mines have more concentrated explosions than grenades so the chance of collateral damage is smaller; as for the target, it's very messy).
</li><li> Subverted by the "Hidden Mines" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> which are only visible by discolorations on the floor or putting your mouse cursor over them, do not beep, and will explode instantly if stepped on. They are often found in dark areas to make them even more difficult to spot.
</li><li> Also subverted by the Satchel Charge mines in the <em>Lonesome Road</em> DLC, which are hard to see, have short fuses that may prevent you from disarming them before they detonate, and are more lethal than the standard mines.
</li><li> Both <em>3</em> and <em>New Vegas</em> play with this trope by having many of the standard frag mines placed in ways that hide the glowing light, such as stuffing them under traffic cones or placing them lit-side-down. There are also a few cases of mines being used as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">Schmuck Bait</a>, by placing one mine very prominently in the open with a second mine near enough to it that anyone trying to disarm the first mine will trigger the second one.
</li><li> Mines in earlier <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> titles are triggered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressurePlate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressurePlate">Pressure Plates</a> that look very similar to the surrounding floor, detonate immediately and require a Traps skill check to spot.

Of course, if you can get the enemy to wander into them, all the more fun.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon">First Encounter Assault Recon</a></em> has the AT-S, a disc-shaped mine with an obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedForYourConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedForYourConvenience">color coded</a> flashing light on top (red for enemy-placed mines, green or blue for yours). You can't throw them very far and they barely bounce around when hitting the ground, but they do explode on contact with a hostile when mid-flight; after they land and are armed, they'll jump up like a bouncing betty when triggered before exploding. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationRerelease">Compilation Rereleases</a>, you can pick your thrown mines back up.

You can punch surfaces with your grenades to set traps. This was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebreaker">gamebreaker</a> at the beginning of 2's multiplayer, because everyone spawned with one smoke grenade. This smoke grenade released smoke as a byproduct of what was apparently an omnidirectional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">force</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">wave.</a> This not only obscured the screen, but it also threw players up into the air, dropped them onto their backs, and then stunned them for several seconds before they could get back up and do anything. It also made people drop the meatflag, meatshields, and boomshields. Fortunately, this was nerfed so that all that happened was that you'd be stunned for a moment, drop the meatflag or a meatshield, or lose your boomshield if you weren't covering behind it.
<ul><li> You can plant the other types of grenades as well. They beep when they're about to detonate. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">To the person on the receiving end, this means that they're</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius">in an instant death radius and are almost certainly going to die.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Geneforge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Geneforge">Geneforge</a></em> series, mines are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> artificial life forms. Trap mines, which can be disarmed, will go click and have a short pause between triggering and detonation. Spore mines, on the other hand, will go off as soon as a target is close enough. There's also a scene in the fourth game in which a servile has stepped on a spore mine not targeted at serviles and irritated it enough that it's ready to go off anyway. The player can either help the poor guy and disable the mine or let him panic and trigger it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1">Half Life 1</a></em> has two types.
<ul><li> Laser-tripwire mines are found as a level obstacle, and Gordon can get a few for himself throughout the game. Once placed, the mine releases a warning whine for a few seconds then emit a faint blue laser (it's visible to the naked eye but only one type of NPC actually takes notice). If you break the laser, the mine will instantly explode without warning; even if you have full health and armor, if you're caught in the blast the mine WILL kill you. They cannot be defused, only prematurely detonated via gunfire or explosions; on the other hand, they stick to the wall hard enough to hold your weight so you can stand on top of them and use them as impromptu stairsteps. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">One particularly difficult level</a> in the chapter "Surface Tension" is a missile warehouse <em>littered</em> with these mines; the location is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">referred to as "Mine Maze" by fans</a>, and needless to say, triggering even one mine, distance be damned, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">is a BAD IDEA</a>. To worsen things, there are a few Headcrabs blissfully unaware of the danger of the place and will happily trigger a tripwire trying to jump at you.
</li><li> Some single player maps like the outside of the "Mine Maze" also sport invisible conventional landmines that could only be safely detonated by splash damage from your explosives; in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackMesa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackMesa">Black Mesa</a></em> they were made visible and vulnerable to gunfire due to the decreased amount of explosives the player is likely to have.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em> has the hopper mines, landmines with stake-like feet that stab the ground to keep the mine in place. Hoppers beep and flash if a hostile gets near them; when triggered, they disengage the stakes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">hop in the air</a> with a quick "beep beep" and explode when hitting any solid surface. their main counter is the Gravity Gun: you can either rip the Hopper out of the floor or catch it as it hops, then either re-plant it on the ground (whereupon it'll be neutral to Gordon and Resistance members, and consider the Combine and non-Vortigaunt aliens as hostile) or just launch it like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveBarrels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveBarrels">explosive barrel</a> at something you want to be destroyed.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3">Halo 3</a></em> - Trip mines beep loudly and glow, they are not hard to find at all. However, their explosive radius and damage are quite impressive, so if you hide them well or place them at opportune moments, they can be very deadly. It's also possible to actually walk over the mines without setting them off. You just have to crouch while walking by them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">It doesn't work all the time though.</a>
<ul><li> What results in the most mine kills is that the maps which feature vehicles and landmines often have a rather rough terrain, which means that it's quite possible to die because you never got a chance to correct your course.
</li><li> There are also landmines which serve as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BorderPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BorderPatrol">Border Patrol</a> in "Sandtrap". They're like a bouncing betty that will go off no matter what you do. You can avoid them by either flying or by driving a vehicle so that you are outside of the damage radius by the time they go off.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomsOfAmalurReckoning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomsOfAmalurReckoning">Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning</a>:</em> The Temple of Aodh has magical land mines. If you get too close to those inconspicuous round areas on the floor, a glowing column pops up, giving you a couple of seconds to run away before it explodes. Try not to run over another one!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em> and the sequel feature mines with transparent red bubbles around them indicating their trigger radius once you spot them, which takes maybe one rank in the Awareness skill.
</li><li> Newly added in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, mines make a distinctive click and give the player enough time to dodge roll out of the way before they go off. Unless the evil, evil level designers put a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">shiny new weapon</a> right next to the mine, in which case the same button for "jump out of the way" instead performs the "pick up the weapon" command, resulting in the mine blowing Shepard up once you dismiss the resulting pick up menu. There are also several PC controlled land mines, as well. Garrus and several Multiplayer characters have the Proximity Mine, a small explosive that sticks to the wall, floor, or ceiling and detonates when an enemy walks near it. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Volus Engineer</a> adds the Recon Mine, which emits a wide scanning field that alerts you to enemies that are near it and only goes off when you issue a command for it (leaving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomCloud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomCloud">Mushroom Cloud</a>), while the Talon Mercenary Engineer packs the brutal Cane Trip Mine, a massive bomb that uses a tripwire laser to detect an enemy's presence.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor">Medal of Honor</a></em>. Land mines instantly kill you if you step beyond the signs. In one of <em>Allied Assault</em>'s expansion packs, you have to probe your way through a minefield with a mine detector.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> had Claymore mines, special mines using fiber optic technology that would render itself invisible. They would explode if the player stepped into its field of "vision." Claymores can show up on the radar as yellow dots and cones if the player has a mine detector, but using a thermal visor would let you physically see the mines. Crawling over a Claymore would let you pick it up and add it to your inventory. Of course, they can be shot out as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3">Metroid Prime 3</a></em> used two different mines and both were in plain sight and were easy to shoot from a distance if you didn't rush into the room. One mine was a standard proximity mine that blew up if you got too close. The other mine type was similar to the bouncing betty one mentioned in the top of the page; if you got too close, the mine would jump up, fire a laser in 360 degrees, then explode.

Combining them all tends to turn a whole area into a deathtrap. For your enemies, as this <em>is</em> the future, and mines are smarter now. Still, you're advised to still keep out of the blast radius, as "the laws of physics don't pick sides". And don't worry about conventions being violated; you're fighting a bunch of crazed aliens <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and the god who crashed your ship</span>, they don't <em>have</em> laws and customs of war.

This works both ways, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoobyTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoobyTrap">landmines mixed in with explosive caches aren't always inert</a>, so look carefully before picking one up.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeShift">Time Shift</a></em> mines have a very short delay before going off, thankfully you have time powers.
</li><li> <em>TNK III</em> and its NES adaptation, <em>Iron Tank</em>, feature blinking and beeping anti-tank mines. Instantly fatal to touch.
</li><li> There is a certain location in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Transarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Transarctica">Transarctica</a></em>, crucial to the main quest, which is accessible only through a labyrinth of booby-trapped tracks. Since triggering a mine will destroy your train immediately, the only way to pass through is to use <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> line inspection cars to detonate it. However, after doing this the player has to repair the damaged track in order to move farther.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Turok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Turok">Turok</a> 2</em> has the Proximity Fragmentation Mine Layer. A mine has a flashing green light and when set off, it turns red, goes "beep" and jumps up, Bouncing Betty style, before exploding and cutting the enemy in half.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a></em> uses comic-book style onomatopoeia as part of its visual style, so the land mines not only click when you step on them but the <em>word</em> "click" appears. The good news: They don't actually explode until you move off them, so if you heal yourself or have another unit disarm it first you could easily survive.
<ul><li> Instantly making it vastly superior to Red Alert's method (see below), which is just step SPROING "Where the hell did my tanks/soldiers go?" At least VC has a counter, Red Alert requires Mine-Stompers (Which can get expensive to use $950 Heavy Tanks to clean out a Minefield).
</li></ul></li><li> These turn up as surprises in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wasteland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wasteland">Wasteland</a></em>, a future RPG. You could avoid them with sufficient Perception skill from your leader.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Worms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Worms">Worms</a></em> series, land mines always make a noise and light when activated. Except for the first game, where the only beep a few times without a light before exploding. Either way, this extra time does not help you get away from them, as the blast radius is larger than the detection radius, but a quick player may be able to position their worm so the explosion doesn't throw it into water.
<ul><li> In some games you can attack a landmine and have it go flying. Some games even have achievements for offing an opponent like this. It's also practical since in most games you're given limited ammo, but you can prod or whack a mine with baseball bats or your finger, which are generally set to Unlimited.

To escape, he unties his boot and does an unnecessarily impressive backflip as the mine goes off.
</li><li> A member of Easy Company steps on a landmine and hears it go click in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeaser">The Teaser</a> to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold">Batman: The Brave and the Bold</a></em> episode "The Plague of the Prototypes".

</li><li> Gags involving minefields were very common on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em>. Usually it involved one character setting up the mines for another character but ending up in the middle of the field and having to slowly make his way back to safety. Since the mines were easily detectable under conspicuous mounds of dirt, the character manages to escape without a scratch... until he unwittingly steps on that one mine he hid too well.
<ul><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpeedyGonzales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpeedyGonzales">Speedy Gonzales</a> &amp; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaffyDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaffyDuck">Daffy Duck</a> episode comes to mind. For some reason, Daffy lays a minefield with all the locations marked. Daffy loses the map, but Speedy winds up with it and offers to tell Daffy where the mines are. Daffy takes a step... &lt;Boom!&gt; "There's one!" &lt;Boom&gt; "There's another!" &lt;Boom&gt; "What do you mean you don't know where they are? You haven't missed one yet!"
<ul><li> And if it's a Roadrunner and Coyote cartoon, Roadrunner runs through all the mines without setting them off, and when Coyote goes to check what's wrong, they all blow up in his face. He also has a habit of being tossed into ones unrelated to his current plan when his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcmeProducts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcmeProducts">Acme Products</a> inevitably backfire.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> A example of this trope happens in the series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RoughnecksStarshipTroopersChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RoughnecksStarshipTroopersChronicles">Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles</a></em> where one of the main characters (the cameraman that supposedly is "documenting" the actions of the titular squad) runs into a minefield while trying to escape from the enemy. A <em>big</em> minefield. With accompanying Loud Click, and the reveal that lifting his foot would detonate not only the mine, but the entire minefield through the explosion of the first mine. The squad has a robotic member that they are in the process of field-testing - the robot makes a Heroic Sacrifice after running out of ammo. He runs in, replaces our main character's foot with his own, and literally throws him clear of the minefield. The robot then waits for the enemy to get real close to him (the enemy naturally not setting off any of the mines on their way), then lifts his foot. Afterward, the troopers deliver a Aesop while ruminating on the sacrifice.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder11');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder11" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Almost completely averted - and backfired - in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>. Land mines are by default designed to explode immediately on the impulse, such as stepping on the pressure plate. The only situation where you hear them going "click" is when they are <strong>duds</strong>.
<ul><li> Having said that, there are <em>delayed fuses</em> which detonate the mine with a delay. They are usually used to let the enemy advance to a choke point where the explosion will cause even more damage.
</li></ul></li><li> There have been several cases where this trope has caused people to think that they've stepped on a landmine (obviously all cases involved completely unrelated bits of scrap metal or no longer functional mines).
</li><li> Pressure release triggers are known to be used in some mine designs, as an anti-handling device (booby-trap) to protect a bigger mine from being disarmed. The action of lifting this sort of mine up after it's set will trigger it - which doesn't help you if you've already stepped on it, though...
<ul><li> Related to the above, a common dirty trick is to pull the pin from a grenade, then set whatever mine you have handy on top of it to hold the spoon down. Moving the mine releases the spoon, which you might hear before it goes boom. Sometimes, the mine is even left exposed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">Schmuck Bait</a> for EOD personnel.
</li></ul></li><li> Pressure release IEDs have been encountered in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan - although they do not go 'click', and are usually pre-counterweighted, so that removing the counterweight, not stepping off the device, is what causes detonation...
</li><li> The Swedish ambassador once remonstrated the Finnish for using landmines. Whereupon the Finnish ambassador replied, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">"Finland is your land mine"</a>.
<ul><li> The Finnish anti-personnel land mine, <em>Sakaramiina m/65</em> (affectionally known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteAsABouncingBetty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteAsABouncingBetty">"Sakke"</a> (boy's name)) was especially designed to maim, not kill, the enemy soldiers. Wounded soldiers bind more of the enemy's resources than dead.
</li></ul></li><li> Sometimes the land mines are not used against the enemy soldiers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">but civilians</a>. Especially in the Third World it is commonplace to deliberately plant anti-personnel mines into farmland. The rationale is to deny the civilians the use of farmland for crops and to cause poverty and famine. Naturally, this very much qualifies as crossing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>.
<ul><li> This also has the secondary effect of making the (presumably enemy) population move and initiating ethnic cleansing (they are gone) plus genocide (when people need to flee for longer periods of time first the old and the young die and then slowly the rest). In Third World conflicts which are often fought over years or even generations that can translate in substantial advantages down the line... or you people just did not care where they planted mines.
</li></ul></li><li> Unexploded Ordnance (bombs and shells that never exploded) is often effectively a land mine. Worse, in a way, as unlike land mines, no one has any reason to want them there— they're often left over from a war that ended decades ago (as far back as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>), and are only there because no one ever got around to clearing them out.
<ul><li> The largest non-nuclear explosives in history were dropped all across Europe during WW2. About 20 or so of them have not detonated.
</li><li> Especially common in Germany. A few undetonated bombs are found every year, normally during building construction.
</li><li> France as well. For all intents and purposes it was the western front in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, and thirty years later it got bombed, shelled and fought over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">again</a>. Unsurprisingly, they're still digging up unexploded ordnance almost a century after the first war and seventy years after the fighting stopped.
<ul><li> A brief note on the scale of the problem in France. The French démineurs (UXO specialists) recover about 900 <em>tons</em> of munitions from the area around Verdun each year alone. Areas have been evacuated during clearing operations due to the high risk of badly corroded chemical munitions going off.
</li></ul></li><li> We can add <a class="urllink" href="http://www.newsmax.com/TheWire/unexploded-bomb-hong-kong/2014/02/06/id/551329/">Hong Kong<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to that list as well.
</li><li> Spain too. While much less frequently than on the countries above, unexploded ordnance from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishCivilWar">Spanish Civil War</a> is stil found either during building construction or in lonely places.
</li><li> This one has to take the cake though: in 2015, unexploded ordnance was found in Washington state that dates back to <em><a class="urllink" href="http://warisboring.com/articles/america-still-has-a-problem-with-unexploded-civil-war-bombs/">the Civil War<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, over <strong>150 years old.</strong>
</li></ul></li><li> World War era torpedoes that were set to contact-fuses often had a one second delay between impact and detonation, so anyone inside the vessel near the point of impact would hear a distinct click right before the explosion.
</li><li> Chilean ambassdador and politician Luis Winter lost both legs in the Chilean-Peruvian border due to this.
</li><li> Organizations such as APOPO have trained rats (specifically, the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambian_pouched_rat">Gambian pouched rat<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) to detect land mines in Africa for just this reason. The rats' noses are sensitive enough to detect explosives like dogs do, but rats are also small enough that they can walk directly over a mine without triggering it. Having proven themselves in their native land, mine-detecting rats are now exported to Southeast Asia as well.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_gardens">The Devil's Gardens<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a German defensive line that was made in Egypt during the North Africa Campaign of World War II. Even after <em>more than sixty years</em> since the line was made, most of the <strong>3 million</strong> land mines that were buried there are STILL unaccounted for, creating a deadly and uninhabitable place that claims the unsuspecting human or grazing animal from time to time.
</li><li> The infamous legacy of the SovietAfghan War was the contamination of <em>more than 530 square kilometers</em> of land with <strong>10 million</strong> land mines and unexploded ordnance which has caused serious long-term damage to the development of the country through the depopulation of large tracts of arable land, resulting in even more problems such as drastically smaller crop harvests. Even to this day, efforts to identify and render the contaminated areas safe enough for resettling through de-mining and ordnance disposal are still ongoing.
