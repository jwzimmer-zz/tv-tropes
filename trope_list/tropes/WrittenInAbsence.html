<p>A character who should be here <em>isn't</em> here, and the extent of acknowledgment of the absence is limited to a few lines in the dialog, as if to say, "Yeah, we know they're not here, so here's an explanation and let's move on."

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/UFOKamenYakisoban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/UFOKamenYakisoban">UFO Kamen Yakisoban</a></em> had spin-off ads featuring Yakisobany, Yakisoban's cousin, who came to protect Earth while Yakisoban was away.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Anime &amp; Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> During the Pain Invasion Arc in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, an ANBU named Ko Hyuuga mentions to Hinata that Hiashi and Hanabi are out of town on a mission, which is relevant since the original Ino-Shika-Cho trio is actively involved in the battle, and is Kiba's mom.
</li><li> A truly bizarre case is the second story of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UruseiYatsura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UruseiYatsura">Urusei Yatsura</a></em> manga, which is the only story in the manga that doesn't contain Lum at all. In fact, Lum is not even mentioned, and Shinobu takes her place in the story.
<ul><li> Not bizarre at all when you consider that <em>Ataru</em> is the actual protagonist, was meant to be the actual "star" of the manga, and that that he was originally supposed to be in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTruePairing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTruePairing">OTP</a> with Shinobu. Takahashi originally wanted UY to be an anthology revolving around Ataru, with Lum as a throwaway gag character for that story. but Lum became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">the most popular character in the series</a> and so, barring one other story, she figured in all of the manga. (This is also why, for the first year or so, Lum is a lot more malicious in the manga than the later sweet-with-a-twist-of-Tsundere character she became. It seems that Takahashi toyed with making her at best an antagonist or, at worst, a borderline villain before realizing that just didn't work.)
</li><li> Chapter 60 is very similar, as it stars Ran and Ataru instead of Lum. Lum only appears on the chapter cover, where it is revealed that she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged">Bound and Gagged</a> inside a closet, explaining why she isn't in this story.

Her older brother Kyouya is the only one who is absent, with it being explained that he's currently in Germany with his girlfriend.

<ul><li> During the events of "Boast Busters", Fluttershy was nowhere to be seen. In this continuity, it's explained that she was at home caring for a sick chickadee at the time.
</li><li> In chapter 3 of the fourth story, <em>The Diplomat's Life</em>, Applejack asks why Cadance's parents weren't at her wedding. Cadance explains that Chrysalis had them kidnapped (because they would have easily been able to identify Chrysalis as an imposter), with a couple of changelings impersonating them and pretending they had to be in a hospital at the time. When Cadance and Shining Armor stopped by to visit them en route to the Crystal Empire, they caught on to the impersonation and rescued the couple from their prison.

L, played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LindaFiorentino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LindaFiorentino">Linda Fiorentino</a>, had been first shown as a morgue worker, then shown as Jay's partner at the end of the first movie, and then carried over to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MenInBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MenInBlack">Animated Series</a>. The given reason for Laurel being written off was Linda Fiorentino apparently being an insanely difficult actress to work with.
</li><li> Early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OceansThirteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OceansThirteen">Ocean's Thirteen</a></em>, we're told that Tess (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuliaRoberts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuliaRoberts">Julia Roberts</a>) and Isabel (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CatherineZetaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CatherineZetaJones">Catherine Zeta-Jones</a>) aren't participating in this caper because "it's not their fight."
</li><li> Another justified example is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpeciesII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpeciesII">Species II</a></em> where Dan Smithson is said to be unwilling to help track another alien, having been deeply disturbed by the events of the first movie.

</li><li> Two other characters, Maria the Short Waitress and Captain Alberto Bertorelli, had their disappearances explained away in a similarly perfunctory manner - Maria, in an effort to escape a Nazi POW camp where she was hiding while in drag accidentally mailed herself to Switzerland; and when the Italians dropped out of WWII, Captain Bertorelli disappeared (perhaps back home, perhaps shot by the Nazis - the exact nature of his vanishing is left vague).
</li><li> Herr Flick is missing from the epilogue, without any explanation (though since he and Smallhausen were last seen surrounded by British soldiers with orders to capture them, one can assume things didn't work out for them).

Angel retorts that he's not gone, he's taking a leave of absence, which was given the in-universe justification that he had thought he had killed his father in the previous ep "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS05E07Lineage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS05E07Lineage">Lineage</a>".

Dr. Franklin and G'Kar, whose actors had died in the interim, are explained as having gone "beyond the Rim".

The writers sent his character, Pops, on a trip to Bermuda in order to explain his sudden absence.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>:
<ul><li> Quite a few episodes from season four needed some mention of why Joyce wasn't around, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> got second thoughts about killing her off, and then had to work around the schedule she had set up thinking she would be off the show that season.

One episode described her as being on a "walkabout", which is more than was given for any of the other absences.
</li><li> The season 2 episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS2E16BewitchedBotheredAndBewildered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS2E16BewitchedBotheredAndBewildered">Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered</a>" is noticeably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">Xander-centric</a>, and Buffy spends much of the later half transformed into a rat due to a witch's spell. This is because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SarahMichelleGellar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SarahMichelleGellar">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a> was leaving for a while to appear on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em>, so the episode was written in a matter of days and her scenes were filmed first. The rushed schedule doesn't seem to have hurt the episode, as it's a personal favorite of many fans and production members (plus, having an episode with Buffy unable to come in and save the day adds a higher level of tension).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em> has done this for various characters. Dan does not show up in four episodes of the second season (it's said that he is on a vacation in "Astral Monkey"); Cole is absent in "Pardon My Past" because he wants to know his personality; and Darryl moved to the east coast since his actor suddenly dropped out. There was also a situation in which Leo was frozen.
</li><li> In the episode "25 to Life" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em>, Aaron "Hotch" Hotchner does not appear, with the only explanation being a few seconds of dialogue where Rossi is seen ending a phone conversation with Hotch telling him to "take as much time as he needs". This was due to Thomas Gibson, who plays Hotch, taking time off to take in a golf tournament.
</li><li> Gil Grissom was absent for several episodes on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamPetersen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamPetersen">William Petersen</a> did a play. Grissom was sent to a college for a seminar, in the same city where Petersen was doing the play.
</li><li> Anna Belknap went on maternity leave twice during her stint on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY">CSI: NY</a></em>. The first time, Lindsay goes home to Montana for the trial of the guy who murdered her high school friends. The second time, Lindsay was pregnant with Danny's child and went on maternity leave, too, back to Montana to visit her parents, but returned in time for Lucy's birth.
</li><li> An especially poignant example occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DadsArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DadsArmy">Dad's Army</a></em>, in which Captain Mainwaring reads out a note left by Private Walker to excuse his absence - the actor who portrayed Walker, James Beck, had fallen into a coma before the episode was filmed and passed away, meaning that he never returned.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLikeMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLikeMe">Dead Like Me</a></em>, Betty is gone for one episode due to being trapped in a morgue. We don't see her there, but we hear her shouting for help.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first 6 seasons of the classic series, the actors playing the Doctor and his companions were often given a week or two off per season, due to the long, frenetic, stressful filming schedule (40 to 44 episodes a year). Since the characters travel randomly throughout time and space, they can't just go on vacation. So the reasons for missing an episode or two vary—sometimes they're held hostage and/or prisoner, a few times the Doctor was in a coma (played by a double, from the back), once he was being put into permanent suspended animation, once a Sufficiently Advanced Alien made him invisible. (Brief pre-filmed scenes were also used.)
</li><li> In Seasons 15 to 18, K9 is often left out of stories, sometimes with a cameo in the first and/or last episode, sometimes not. Explanations included being unable to handle swampy terrain (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">which the prop couldn't</a>) and still being in the TARDIS when it's buried by a rockfall. (In the former case, because he was contracted as a regular cast member, the actor who provided his voice played a guest character in the story, getting a rare chance to show his face onscreen.)
</li><li> In the modern revival, they've had a few "Doctor-lite" episodes where it focuses on someone who has never been seen on the TV show, to give the Doctor and his companion some time to film the Christmas specials.
<ul><li> Although in series 4, this method was changed to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E10Midnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E10Midnight">one episode</a> focusing all on the Doctor, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E11TurnLeft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E11TurnLeft">another</a> focusing on Donna.
</li><li> And in series 5, they had an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS31E11TheLodger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS31E11TheLodger">Amy-lite episode</a>, but <em>not</em> a Doctor-lite one, despite him also doing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSarahJaneAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSarahJaneAdventures">The Sarah Jane Adventures</a></em>, The Proms, and the video scenes for the Doctor Who Experience!
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> During the filming of the second series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey">Downton Abbey</a></em>, Penelope Wilton spent some weeks starring in the play <em>A Delicate Balance</em> at the Almeida Theatre, so Isobel Crawley was packed off to France for several episodes, the in-universe reason being that she was serving as a nurse with the Red Cross. (Fortunately, this was an entirely characteristic move for Isobel.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDukesOfHazzard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDukesOfHazzard">The Dukes of Hazzard</a></em>:
<ul><li> Deputy Enos Strate was absent for two episodes in season two, being temporarily replaced by the debuting Cletus Hogg. The Balladeer explained that the doctor had to "separate Enos from his appendix". This write-in was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>; actor Sonny Shroyer really <em>was</em> in the hospital<em>for appendicitis</em>.
</li><li> Also in Season 2, Sheriff Rosco Coltrane was missing for a short stretch due to a contract dispute with actor James Best. His absence was explained as Rosco having been forced to go to the police academy for re-certification. Several actors filled in as cameo substitutes during the interim before the dispute was settled and Rosco returned to Hazzard. One of the temporary replacements was, appropriately enough, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">Dick Sargent</a>. (It appears they were ready to possibly put him in permanently in case Best walked; he had two appearances and was one of two replacements (the other was James Hampton) to make it to the opening credits.)
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">Suspiciously Similar Substitute</a> situation when Coy and Vance stepped in for Bo and Luke in much of season five is well-known, but John Schneider sat out "Baa, Baa White Sheep" in season three for another reason - he was shooting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie">Made-for-TV Movie</a> <em>Dream House</em>, so Bo went off to spend a weekend in the Marine Corps.
</li></ul></li><li> In a non-temporary example, perhaps the weirdest subversion of this in the history of <em>ever</em> came in the third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DueSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DueSouth">Due South</a></em>. When David Marciano left the show, his character, Ray Vecchio, was actually recast with a replacement character who, apparently, shared the same name. His replacement was actually Stanley Raymond Kowalski, an undercover cop pretending to be Vecchio, while they explained that the real Vecchio was undercover elsewhere. (If you can think of a weirder way to explain in-story why an actor is gone, I would be very interested to hear it.)
</li><li> By the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em>, Virginia Hey, the actress who portrayed Zhaan, had bad reactions to her extensive makeup. Zhaan eventually decided to focus on her spiritual training, allowing her to spend a lot of time meditating while the rest of the crew got themselves in trouble. Zhaan is eventually killed off by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">having her sacrifice herself</a> to save the ship and crew.
<ul><li> Rebecca Riggs was unavailable for filming of "Bad Timing" as she was getting married. Commandant Grayza is said to have been confined to her quarters after Captain Braca staged a mutiny against her at the end of the previous episode.

The party was not at Cheers but somewhere else, and only Norm, Carla and a few of the recurrers were at the party. Sam and the Cheers bar itself were explained away by Sam hosting a Red Sox reunion at Cheers that night, and thus unable to make it. (Of course, in reality the <em>Cheers</em> set was dismantled once the show ended. In fact, <em>Frasier</em> was shot on the same stage.)

Thus they could explain in-universe that the reason Blaine was absent for two episodes was that he had to have surgery on his eye and stay home from school.

George is absent for most of the episode, but the writers have people constantly talk <strong>about</strong> him. This was supposed to distract viewers from noticing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he is in fact never on screen, because the episode's wham ending (where he turns out to be the John Doe that saved a girl from being hit by a bus only to get hit himself) absolutely requires this</span>.

</li><li> A plotline introduced at the end of season 3 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana">Hannah Montana</a></em> that Oliver Oken would be discovered for his singing ability and go on tour set up his actor, Mitchel Musso's absence for most of the fourth and final season (save for two episodes, including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale">Series Finale</a>). This was because of Musso's having left the series to star in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyXD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyXD">Disney XD</a> series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PairOfKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PairOfKings">Pair of Kings</a></em> and serve as the host of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrankStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrankStars">PrankStars</a></em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em> had this quite a lot:
<ul><li> The first episode of the fourth season shows the absences of Foreman, Chase, and Cameron (who quit in one episode of season 1 before coming back). All of them were fired or resigned. By the following of the fourth season, only Foreman appears in the team while the others failed to participate in a few episodes.
</li><li> Done also to Wilson after he left temporary the hospital due to an argument with House regarding Amber.
</li><li> In the first episode of the sixth season, House was temporarily deprived of his medical license and also had to stay in a mental hospital without any visits except a call from Wilson.
</li><li> Taub and Thirteen were dropped out with Taub being absent for four episodes while Thirteen only missed two and were present in the two others although she wasn't on the team anymore.
</li><li> Cameron and Thirteen had it worse. The first left the team and only came back for two episodes while the second abruptly vanished in sixteen episodes of the seventh season before returning until the end. She also came back for three episodes of the final season.
</li><li> Cuddy wasn't on the show anymore after the seventh season. Foreman wanted to tell House her new place but he cut him saying that he didn't need any details.
</li><li> Also, Chase and Taub didn't appear in the first four episodes, leaving House to find the money in order to rebuild a team. Taub also missed one episode where he must take care of his daughter while Chase left the hospital (because Jesse Spencer was cast on another show) near the end of the series.
</li><li> Foreman missed a few episodes for the final season while Wilson only was absent in two. Adams and Park weren't present in one (not the same). Possibly explained by the fact that the actors agreed to drop their salary out in order to save the show.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly">iCarly</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sam is absent in "iWon't Cancel the Show" due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JennetteMcCurdy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JennetteMcCurdy">Jennette McCurdy</a> being in the hospital for a tonsillectomy. It is mentioned that she is in juvie for shoving a hot chili dog down a foreign dignitary's pants. In this case, though, her absence is pivotal to the episode's plot.
</li><li> Noah Munck (Gibby) was the only main cast member still under 18 at the time and couldn't work as many hours per day during shooting. This normally led to his character mentioning how he had to leave all of a sudden (usually making a comical exit) halfway during scenes that he initially was slated to have lines in the entire scene, while his original lines were rewritten for someone else such as Freddie or Sam to say. Sometimes if an episode ran long, they edited a scene out that Gibby was supposed to do on the web show, from the actual episode. The writers then had the other characters mention how they plan to cut Gibby from that week's web show. Occasionally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>.
</li><li> Carly was sent off to take care of her grandfather in Yakima and only seen at the beginning and end of the episode. This was because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MirandaCosgrove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MirandaCosgrove">Miranda Cosgrove</a> had broken her ankle in a bus accident while touring and had not healed enough yet.

</li><li> Lalaine's character Miranda was left out of the last few shot episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LizzieMcGuire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LizzieMcGuire">Lizzie McGuire</a></em>, and Lizzie always had some excuse for her not being there (Usually, she said Miranda was on vacation in Mexico). Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> came out without Miranda. The poor girl missed her own middle school graduation.
</li><li> This happened often in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LondonsBurning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LondonsBurning">London's Burning</a></em>, when the character in question doesn't get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousWorkplace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousWorkplace">spectacularly killed off.</a> A line of dialogue will mention that a missing character has moved on, usually early in the opening episode of a new series, and then that'll be pretty much that. Towards the end of the series, they didn't even bother with <em>that</em>, even for station cook Maggie who'd been a major cast member since the very first episode. Only a few characters ever got a proper send-off without dying.

<ul><li> Radar spent an unusually large amount of time "away on R&amp;R" in the character's last couple of seasons, due to actor Gary Burghoff's contractually-limited appearances.

Philip Michael Thomas was actually injured during a stunt in the previous episode, "Made For Each Other."
</li><li> Due to Steven Hill refusing to work Friday evenings and Saturdays because he was an Orthodox Jew, which screwed up the shooting schedule and eventually led to him being fired, Dan Briggs doesn't appear in many episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible">Mission: Impossible</a></em> after the team briefing scene. Some (but not all) of them have him claim he can't be in the field for that episode because someone involved in the plot they're defusing knows him and would realize something was up if they saw him there. The final season explained Lynda Day George missing the first third of the season (she was pregnant) by saying that her character, Lisa Casey, was on assignment in Europe.
</li><li> In Season 10 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurdochMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurdochMysteries">Murdoch Mysteries</a></em>, morgue scenes in episodes that don't feature Miss James will mention that she's being kept busy at the medical school.
</li><li> Pete and Manu missed quite a number of episodes <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyKitchenRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyKitchenRules">My Kitchen Rules</a></em>'s Season 6. Both judges were completely absent in the 3rd round of the competition, as the "secret teams" were led by Colin Fassnidge. Colin also took Manu's place as the co-judge of the season's first People's Choice Challenge. The exact reason of their absences weren't really explained, but Pete and Manu did mention that the two <em>won't</em> be traveling with the contestants for <em>all</em> their challenges because Colin will do it instead.

(Because Juliette <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenInInfirmity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenInInfirmity">was also pregnant</a>, this is the only season three episode where Hayden doesn't appear.)
</li><li> Repeatedly on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Numb3rs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Numb3rs">NUMB3RS</a></em>:
<ul><li> When Peter MacNicol took a temporary leave of absence during the second season to be in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> his character, Larry Fleinhardt, (a professor of Cosmology) spent six months on the International Space Station. Since the showrunners knew about it well in advance, they wrote in a several-episode build-up to the launch.
</li><li> In the same season, Diane Farr (Megan Reeves) took a temporary leave of absence because she was pregnant. This was written into the script as Reeves being forced into a special assignment, which would form the basis for much of her character arc in Season 4.
</li><li> This escalates to the point of ridiculous in the last two seasons, due to budgetary concerns. It was too expensive to have as many series regulars as they had appear in every episode, so it became common for only three of the four supporting FBI agents to be present at a time. This is usually given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> or completely ignored, but it does get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in "12:01 AM" (with Colby Granger (Dylan Bruno) being the absent character in that episode).
</li></ul></li><li> During the filming of series four of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnlyFoolsAndHorses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnlyFoolsAndHorses">Only Fools and Horses</a></em>, Lennard Pierce (Grandad) was suddenly taken into hospital, which was explained by having a character ask after the missing Grandad's health. Pierce then died; in the next episode, Grandad's funeral is held and he is replaced by his brother, Uncle Albert.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation">Parks and Recreation</a></em>, the writers pulled out all the stops to justify Andy's absence in season 6 while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisPratt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisPratt">Chris Pratt</a> was filming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a></em> - the entire show took a two-episode trip to England (where <em>Guardians</em> was filmed) and left Andy behind.
</li><li> One of the leads of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Route66" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Route66">Route 66</a></em>, George Maharis, took a leave of absence due to illness, and a few lines of dialogue assign his character Buz the same fate. When Maharis left for good, there are one-line mentions for about two episodes afterward about how Buz is ill and in the hospital again, but no resolution is ever really given. It turns into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">Chuck Cunningham Syndrome</a> scenario, with Tod never mentioning his former best friend and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Heterosexual Life Partner</a> again. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusCrash">Maybe he died.</a>
</li><li> A season premiere for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SabrinaTheTeenageWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SabrinaTheTeenageWitch">Sabrina the Teenage Witch</a></em> has Sabrina (and her aunts) getting ready for Valerie, one of her prominent classmates from last season, to move in, but then later receiving a call from her and finding out that Valerie's staying in Alaska.
</li><li> Star Redd Foxx got into a salary dispute with the producers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SanfordAndSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SanfordAndSon">Sanford and Son</a></em> during its fourth season and was said to be going to St. Louis for a funeral. The funeral apparently lasted a few months. Luckily, the supporting cast, especially Grady, was more than capable of filling the void and Foxx returned for the final two seasons before his (and co-star Demond Wilson's) salary dispute killed the show for good.
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterShow">After Show</a> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSanfordArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSanfordArms">The Sanford Arms</a></em> Fred and Lamont were said to have moved to Arizona <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">"for Fred's health"</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sliders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sliders">Sliders</a></em> had Quinn being absent during half an episode. In reality, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerryOConnell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerryOConnell">Jerry O'Connell</a> asked to have some more time in order to participate in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JerryMaguire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JerryMaguire">Jerry Maguire</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SmartGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SmartGuy">Smart Guy</a></em> has an episode where the eponymous character, TJ Henderson, was absent. It was explained away that TJ was away at a science camp for a week. In addition, it was also somewhat important to the episode, because Floyd Henderson had spent most of his finances on the tuition for the camp, meaning Marcus and Yvette had to get jobs to buy what they wanted. Yvette ended up working in a department store with her (white) best friend; the latter's sole job was following black customers around the store since the owner feared they would shoplift. Marcus got a job at a late-night radio station, despite his dad's insistence that he not get that kind of job.
<ul><li> Similarly, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SisterSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SisterSister">Sister, Sister</a></em>, one episode had Tia and Tamera being absent for most of the episode because they were out of state. They returned in the last few moments of the episode in question, when Tyreke and Jordan were waiting for them at the airport, but they learned from an announcement that the twins flight had been redirected (or so they thought), so they decided to wait out for them, only for the twins to come off shortly after they left.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>, Dr. Crusher's absence (throughout season two) was explained as being "transferred to head Starfleet Medical". In real life, the writers were having trouble developing the character and tried a different approach in Dr. Pulaski. This didn't work out, and there was pressure to bring Crusher back, so she returned in season three, where she remained for the rest of the run.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StargateSG1S10E16BadGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StargateSG1S10E16BadGuys">Bad Guys</a>" Sam Carter was absent from the team. One of the characters explained that she was in Washington briefing the President about the events of a previous episode. "Bad Guys" hinged on the fact that the team <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumBreakdown">couldn't get the Stargate working</a> and had she been present, the episode would have lasted all of ten minutes (the time for her to hook up her Naquadah generator). So it was a good thing overall.
</li><li> Sam was also absent from the first few episodes of season 9, appearing only briefly by video feed, to accommodate Amanda Tapping's pregnancy.
</li><li> When Michael Shanks wasn't available to film an episode due to appendicitis, the writers had to explain why his character Daniel didn't accompany the team on the mission. Showing some very straightforward thinking, they decided that Daniel had appendicitis too. Interestingly, he is still recovering at the beginning of the next season, filmed months later, but set a few weeks in the future.
</li><li> Other episodes where Daniel needs to be absent for most or all of the episode will explain that he's on a dig on another planet. Teal'c will go to spend time with the Jaffa army for the same reasons. Of course, Teal'c has a nearly perfect attendance record in terms of actually appearing in the episodes (only missing one episode in season 8; other episodes which didn't involve him actually showed him leaving or coming back).

</li><li> Speaking of Colonel O'Neill, his screen-time was gradually reduced alongside a promotion to Brigadier General and move to a staff position, which allowed him to be gracefully written out of the spin-offs as simply having retired from the Air Force.
</li></ul></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Taxi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Taxi">Taxi</a></em>, shot while Judd Hirsch was filming his Oscar-nominated performance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OrdinaryPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OrdinaryPeople">Ordinary People</a></em>, only has Alex (his character) in it for one scene — a phone conversation at the very end — saying that he was on a skiing trip.

In some of the cases, the actor gave enough notice for them to write in a death scene, but others left without that, forcing the writers to improvise.
<ul><li> Colton Haynes, who played one of the main characters Jackson Whittemore waffled over leaving at the end of season 2 to join the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>, to the point where they actually shot a death scene for him. Then he indicated he would be back for season 3, so they aired the version of the finale where Jackson survived... only to not come back for season 3, forcing the writers to throw in a bit of dialogue about him moving to London with his parents, and he was never mentioned again.
</li><li> Adelaide Kane who played Cora Hale left after only one season, so she was written as moving back into hiding in South America.
</li><li> Daniel Sharman who plays Isaac Lahey will apparently not be returning for season 4 due to his commitments to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOriginals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOriginals">The Originals</a></em>, but asked the writers to leave the door open to return, so he is being written as moving to France <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to recover after Allison's death</span>.

Of course, she was absent for the entire season because her actress had left the show.

</li><li> Max Russo's actor Jake T. Austin took a short break from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace">Wizards of Waverly Place</a></em> to attend college during the fourth and final season of the series; his absence was explained by a story arc in which Alex botched a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip">transformation spell</a> during a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme">Zany Scheme</a> to restore her powers, and Max was changed to a girl named Maxine (played by Bailee Madison).
</li><li> During the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WMACMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WMACMasters">WMAC Masters</a></em> it originally looked like Eric "Panther" Betts had suffered from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">Chuck Cunningham Syndrome</a> as he disappeared between seasons without mention, however, a few episodes in Tracer tells Warlock that Panther was previously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> working for Jukido (a role the two of them now had) but had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask">become the mask</a> so they had to take him out. In reality, he had broken his hip and thigh during a fight with The Machine and could not compete.
</li><li> Jillian Bell had to miss a few episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Workaholics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Workaholics">Workaholics</a></em> Season 5 to film the TV adaptation of her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Idiotsitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Idiotsitter">Idiotsitter</a></em> videos. In-show, it was explained that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDanza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDanza">Jillian</a> was on leave for National Guard duty.
</li><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidDuchovny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidDuchovny">David Duchovny</a> decided to leave <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em>, his character's absence was written well in one case and badly in another. Season 8 had him abducted and returned for the last few episodes, which fits well with the show's premise. Season 9 starts off with Mulder gone completely, and fans are never given a straight answer as to why he was missing, save for the flimsy excuse that it wasn't "safe" for him to stay with Scully and their new baby, though no one could remember a threat that would warrant such a measure in season 8, and that him leaving goes against his character.

</li><li> An odd variation occurs where an absence isn't stated in the episode itself but is hinted at by the viewers: In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hercules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hercules">Hercules</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin">Aladdin</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover">crossover</a> episode "Hercules and the Arabian Night", Iago is notably the only Aladdin character who has not made an appearance in the episode. <em>Aladdin</em> fans who have seen <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AladdinAndTheKingOfThieves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AladdinAndTheKingOfThieves">Aladdin and the King of Thieves</a></em> will know the reason is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Iago left with Cassim, Aladdin's father, to start a new life</span>.

<ul><li> It was often said that Superman was averting a natural disaster somewhere; after all, having Superman around every episode would often undermine the tension. Subverted once when he actually showed up later in the episode saying the disaster turned out to be relatively minor.
</li><li> This happened pretty often to other members too, as most episodes were missing at least one of the Leaguers, although the absences weren't always explained. One example would be the Christmas episode, which explains that Batman is busy doing monitor duty, although the other absence from that episode - Wonder Woman - is never explained. Of course, even when it's not explained, given that they're superheroes it is easy to assume that they're just busy handling their own crises. Or in that case, she doesn't really celebrate Christmas, given she has actually met Greek gods and is a literal Amazon.

<ul><li> Notable mainly because there are many episodes where main characters don't appear, including Spike several other times, but this is the only one that actually bothers to explain <em>why</em> no appearance was made (although, admittedly, since they were explaining why Spike wasn't asleep in his own bed, they at least had a good reason for explaining this one if no other).

(to the others) Hang on kids, it's gonna be a bumpy ride! <br/><em>(Grandpa Lou re-married in the second Rugrats movie, but the new Grandma, Lulu, only ever appeared sporadically. Her absence here ends up being a minor plot point since this means Grandpa Lou has an extra ticket for Angelica to go to a pop concert. Seriously.)</em>
</div></li><li> Later, we have two back-to-back character absence acknowledgments while everyone who's left is practicing for a disco dance:
<div class="indent"><strong>Didi</strong>: Poor Kira is missing all the fun. <br/><strong>Betty</strong>: Hey, Chazzster, thanks for filling in after Howie's little mishap practicing his dance moves.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllGrownUp">All Grown Up!</a></em> (which incidentally, the above <em>Rugrats</em> episode spawned) had a Christmas special without Angelica (a feat in and of itself, because on <em>Rugrats</em>, Angelica was <em>the</em> main plot of that show's Christmas episodes), with Susie saying one line about Angelica spending her holidays in Aspen. They also explained Dil's general absence in a vacation episode by showing him sick in his room and having Tommy mention that Dil had the flu.

His absence is hinted by Quimby's line of "Thank you, Blood and Tears! Sorry to hear about Sweat." to be due to his either having died recently or had something bad happen to him that forced him not to attend.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> episode "Lightspeed", the titular heroes are nowhere to be seen. The replacement squad, Titans East, had "Returned to Steel City" so the villainous H.I.V.E. five thought they could have free run of the city. A hero does show up later, but he's apparently not affiliated with the Titans (yet).

During his introduction, Geoff mentions that he <em>was</em> originally going to bring Bridgette to the race, but since she was on a surfing tour in Australia, Brody was his second choice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em>: In the premiere of the 3rd season, Tecna notes that all the Specialists except Sky, plus Mirta (a student witch who transferred to the fairies' school last season, falls under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Recurrer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Recurrer">Recurrer</a> status, much loved by the fandom), have RSVP'd for Stella's princess ball. In the next episode at the ball, we see only Brandon and Sky, and in the 4Kids dub Flora notes, "I can't believe Helia's ship broke down," thus explicitly explaining his absence, and implicitly everyone else's (although original Flora was merely noting how Solaria was absolutely splurging for the ball). (It's Flora who notes this because she and Helia are one of the series' couples.)
</li><li> Many episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> won't feature the full team. Since there's a lot of superheroic antics going on outside of what we see in the main plot, the reasons given for whatever member's absence, if any, vary.
