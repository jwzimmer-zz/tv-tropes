At least, according to this trope.
</p><p>Babies mend broken relationships, restore someone's faith in life, and can even stop wars. Even the obligatory <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScreamingBirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScreamingBirth">Screaming Birth</a> won't put onlookers (or the mother) off pondering the magnificence of life — not even onlookers who are normally so easily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squicked</a> out that the messiness of childbirth should have rendered them comatose. All angst is dissolved with their first cry, all the problems in their parents' lives melt away with one glimpse into those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBlueEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBlueEyes">Innocent Blue Eyes</a>, the world's problems seem insignificant next to their first dirty nappy...
</p><p>The positive side of this trope is that it embraces the joyful new beginning that a baby represents. Here is a brand new person, on her way to all of the wonderful experiences that come with being alive. Her chubby-faced cuteness and innocence light up the room, and even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInSourArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInSourArmor">Knight in Sour Armor</a> cannot help but smile back when she flashes her toothless grin at him. She is freshness and newness incarnate, not to mention a chance to start over, try again, and perhaps avoid some of the mistakes of the past.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The negative side of this trope is that it makes childbearing (and child-raising) look far more simple and convenient than you find it in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>. The inconveniences of having a baby are usually downplayed or glossed over, and even previously irresponsible parents will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodParents">instantly willing and able to step up</a> and take responsibility for the newborn. In short, it makes a baby seem like nothing but magic and wonder, when in reality she is sleep-deprivation, a complete disruption of the normal routine, and a whole lot of work — and that's <em>before</em> she starts walking and talking and thinking for herself.
</p><p>This trope can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. For some couples, a baby is indeed the answer to their problem — because their problem is that they don't have any children. For others who are struggling, their intention to have children someday forces them to work together and sort their problems out. There are also many stories of seemingly-unlikely mothers and fathers who take to parenthood like ducks to water and (even if they were shocked or dismayed to learn of the pregnancy at first) now wouldn't have it any other way. Many if not most parents take having a child to care and provide for and to provide a good example for as good reasons to lead productive and well-ordered lives, and some only get their act together once they have that reason.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>However, the fact remains that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> babies are expensive, life-long responsibilities — the very opposite of something that will simplify your life and make fewer problems (a fact that most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstructions</a> of this trope are quick to point out). Babies are not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpiphanyTherapy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpiphanyTherapy">epiphany therapists</a> and definitely not magicians. They are not the key to make a squabbling or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadSparks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadSparks">burnt-out</a> couple suddenly fall back in love and in perfect cooperation. In fact, having children can make some people easier to become victims of domestic abuse, as tying a man or woman to an abusive spouse through a child strips away their freedom to leave the relationship. Resentment towards an unwanted or difficult child is also a major factor in child abuse. Providing babies/toddlers with nutrition, education/stimulation, and everything else they need simply to thrive, grow, and not have major psychological issues or setbacks (much less absolute optimal levels of all of the above to make sure they have a chance at being highly educated/capable) is often beyond the financial reach of many people, and may be absolutely impossible to do well under conditions like war or famine. Then there's the problem of healthcare for both the mother if she experiences complications and/or a child with major physical or intellectual or emotional disabilities needing care for those, which becomes either impossible in less developed societies (leading to such things as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByChildbirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByChildbirth">Death by Childbirth</a> and challenged children being abandoned/forced to beg or be slaves) or possible but at extreme financial and sometimes relational costs in the First World. Then there are some couples that are not equipped to have children, from anything from physical or mental reasons (and no, those mental reasons <em>can't</em> always be fixed via therapy) to simply having existing lives that have no room for children and no desire to quit or cut back on their career or lifestyle to be a "proper" parent.
</p><p>A character impervious to the cuteness of babies is frequently a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildHater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildHater">Child Hater</a>. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenRaiseYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenRaiseYou">Children Raise You</a>, where the situation is less idealistic (though with much the same outcome) and the caretaker is not the child's biological parent.
</p><p>Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBabyTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBabyTrap">The Baby Trap</a>, which is when a character who believes in this trope attempts to invoke it without the knowledge and/or consent of their partner (or, failing that, may resort to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakePregnancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakePregnancy">Fake Pregnancy</a> in hopes of making them stick around), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter">Babies Ever After</a>, where babies are used as proof of a happy ending. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesBabiesEverywhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesBabiesEverywhere">Babies, Babies Everywhere</a> for related tropes. Expect characters who believe this trope criticize others for choosing not to have children of their own, which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWantingKidsIsWeird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWantingKidsIsWeird">Not Wanting Kids Is Weird</a>.

<ul><li> Used with an extra dose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">anvils</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Vandread" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Vandread">Vandread</a></em>. An alien computer virus infects the entire ship when the crew attempts to open a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> data storage, rendering the ship defenseless as enemy forces approach. It also leaves our hero, his love interest and a woman in labor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornInAnElevator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornInAnElevator">stuck in an elevator</a>. Some of the crew patch the comm-system into the elevator so they can give advice to the kids trying to play midwife, and when the baby is born, its first cry echoes through the ship... causing the virus to instantly dissolve. It was actually a defense program to prevent the wrong people from getting their hands on the information in the data-storage, and the 'password' was a baby's first cry. The creator of the time capsule stated that any culture that still sees children born, greeting the world with a cry of sheer life, is worthy of being preserved.
</li><li> Played pretty straight in episode 7 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> R (episode 53 overall), where the Cardian is sent in to attack babies and one of the mothers takes the brunt of an attack meant for her son. The baby, unfortunately has no one to take care of him, so Mamoru, being the good guy that he is, volunteers. Usagi decides to help and the two of them even hold hands when they dance for joy when the little baby begins to walk and talks for the first time. At the time, Mamoru had amnesia and didn't remember anything about loving Usagi. In fact, he clearly found her kind of strange and unpleasant. This one is slightly more excusable since they were just babysitting, and since they weren't sole caretakers of the little one long enough it didn't have time to stop being fun and become reality.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em>, Madam Red <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> marries a man who she does not love because her sister married her beloved. However, when she becomes pregnant, she tells us in a inner monologue that she begins to feel she can really love her husband. When she loses the child in a accident and goes crazy because another woman had an abortion, she begins killing all those expecting mothers who wish to be rid of their children</span>. At the end of it, she expects Ciel to sympathize with her because in her view any woman that doesn't want a child must be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildHater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildHater">shallow tart undeserving of any sympathy</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SakendeYaruze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SakendeYaruze">Sakende Yaruze!</a></em> Shino and Misao think this when they are 17. After actually getting pregnant Misao seems to change her mind a little as she leaves Shino so that having a family will not get in the way of his career.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>. There are no signs of anyone having a kid anytime soon, but in a flashback bonus chapter they show how Natsu came to acquire Happy, which was by finding an egg in the forest that the cat(?) then hatched out of. Moment before Happy's hatching everyone was fighting, but the moment he appeared everyone stopped fighting and cheered up. For this reason, Natsu named the cat 'Happy'.
</li><li> Played with as well in the Sword Fiend filler arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, where Hisagi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> zanpakutou, Kazeshini, has continued to hunt his owner remorselessly even though Muramasa's control over him was excised. He uses guerilla tactics in a very clear effort to kill his owner (rather than wanting to fight him head-on), until he kills one of the Sword Fiends who tries to kill him. Said sword fiend had just killed a father with a newborn baby, who imprints on Kazeshini and quickly becomes his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">Morality Pet</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Double Subversion</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>. Guts and Casca conceive their child around that point in the story where their relationship is taking a happier turn and they're optimistic that the Band of the Hawk will bounce back from its difficulties. Then their hopes are dashed in the Eclipse, and Femto's rape of Casca causes her to be driven insane and her child to be born misshapen and tainted by evil. To Guts this seems like the last insult after everything he and Casca have been through, and at first he rejects their offspring as a demon. Even the Skull Knight initially says "It would be best to kill it [...] someday it will bring woe upon you both." Yet fate works in mysterious ways indeed: the child ends up becoming more of a miracle for them than they could <em>ever</em> have imagined. First, when Casca strays from the safety of the cave and gives birth to him, his presence prevents the evil spirits from harming her. Then after two years during which Guts has been running away from Casca by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">Walking the Earth</a> on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a>, the child gives him a vision of Casca in danger, leading to him getting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a> lecture from Godo and remembering his priorities. Meanwhile, the child protects Casca from all sorts of perils using his strange powers until Guts can reach her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Another time, when Schierke can't free Guts' ego while he's swept up in the Berserker Armor's blind rage, the Child reaches through to him by reminding him that he's not just a monster after blood; he's Guts the Black Swordsman who protects Casca, the branded girl. The child is even the one who helps guide a battered Guts to the merrows who pull him from the Sea God's sinking body, thereby rescuing him from drowning.</span> Both physically protecting them and constantly reminding them what they mean to each other, it's safe to say that right now Guts and Casca wouldn't be together <em>or</em> alive without him!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans">Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans</a></em>: Atra, due to some advice from Haba, comes to believe in this trope; she believes if Mikazuki had a child, he'd stop his self-destructive habits since he'd have something to live for. She first tries to get Kudelia to do it, who refuses and suggests Atra should be the one to have the child, since it was her idea. Though Mikazuki, who had recently developed an interest in babies, agrees, she comes to realize that even with a child, Mikazuki will never change. In the end, however, they still conceive a child just for themselves.

Cyclops was only with Madelyne because she looked exactly like the woman he loved. The couple later on have a son, but it does nothing to help their fundamentally broken relationship.
</li><li> Played utterly straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a></em>. Even when the characters <em>really</em> didn't want a child (as is the case with Dewshine and Tyldak), the baby is still treated as a small miracle. Later on in the comic, Dewshine is seen absolutely beside herself with joy because her lifemate, Scouter, has made another girl pregnant. Several healers, including Leetah and Rain, have made it practically their life's work to increase the tribe's fertility. Leetah's sister Shenshen is one of her village's most respected members because she's a midwife. Lord Voll forces an entire tribe to bend to his will just so he can see the chief's children; later Winnowill, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, uses one of the kids both as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanShield">Human Shield</a> against the tribe and as motivation for her human pets, who understood elves to be basically sterile. Nonna and Adar, two humans, lead lonely and meaningless lives because they're barren, and are only shown to be truly happy once they've adopted three young orphans. Krim is willing to sacrifice her own life during the war until she finds out she's pregnant. Tyleet adopts a human baby who gets abandoned by his parents. And so on and so forth. The in-story justification for this, at least for the elves, is that elves have long lives and extremely low fertility, so every birth is celebrated no matter how strange the circumstances. As a further touch, almost every elven birth is caused by Recognition, a magical way to ensure that the child is specially gifted as a consequence of that particular genetic union. Of course, none of this stuff explains why the trope is implied to the relatively primitive humans present in the setting. Primitive human societies generally need all the population they can get, too.

In fairness, the natural tendency of akumatisation is to take existing emotions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in order to make the akuma easy to manipulate, so it wasn't really her fault. It even <em>sort of</em> works; her victims go through a fair bit of physical and emotional struggle, but generally do come to love their babies and wouldn't give them up (despite having options on the table, from adoption to actual time travel).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheChildOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheChildOfLove">The Child of Love</a></em>: When Asuka finds out she is pregnant she is initially very wary and reluctant to be mother and Shinji is very scared; however the thought of becoming parents forces them both to gradually come to terms with their feelings for their child's sake. At the same time it is treated a bit more realistically than other examples: Asuka's pregnancy strains their already troubled and complicated relationship massively, and Shinji actually got frightened and ran away for a while.

However Asuka is determined not to repeat their parents' mistakes, and they manage to become good parents to their daughter.

It does manage to execute this trope relatively well in that neither the pregnancy nor birth of his child automatically make Ben's relationship with Alison any better: he has to work <em>really hard</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">to get the happy ending</a> and it takes him a while to figure out how to actually achieve this and get the other parent on board.

They decide that they will steal a baby instead. They decide to return the baby after learning that it won't magically make them more mature and well-adjusted people, but they decide to work through their problems and stay together anyway, and it's suggested that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">eventually get their act together</a> and have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter">Babies Ever After</a>.

That said, much of the comedy in this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dramedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dramedy">Dramedy</a> comes from presenting as a grand adventure the efforts of the youngsters' friends to conceal the pregnancy and bring the baby to birth without the grown-ups finding out about it, and the final scene actually has a choir singing the "Hallelujah Chorus" from Handel's <em>Messiah</em> as everyone celebrates the child's birth. And oh yeah—<a class="urllink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069010/">there's a sequel<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> about what they do with the baby after that.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Breaking Dawn</a></em>
<ul><li> Bella herself admits that she doesn't like babies but two seconds after discovering she is pregnant decides that she wants nothing more than to have Edward's perfect, sparkly, gorgeous baby. Bella and Edward have an unrealistically good marriage (all two days of it) <em>before</em> the pregnancy is discovered and the baby grows up so fast that there is no period of dirty diapers, crying, or spoon feeding. It also plays this straight in the following ways and cements Nessie as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixerSue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixerSue">Fixer Sue</a>:
<ul><li> Nessie instantly patches the relationship between Bella and her new sister-in-law Rosalie, who spent the last three books despising the girl and is pretty much the only Cullen vampire who didn't adore Bella from day one.
</li><li> Nessie is also the perfect soul mate of Bella's own lovelorn suitor Jacob, who is immediately smitten with the child and totally drops whatever feelings he may have had for Bella. His relationship with Edward is thus completely mended, with Edward even calling Jacob his "son" and giving his blessing.
</li><li> Nessie is also also the bridge between the vampires and the wolf pack, since Jacob imprints on her. Therefore, the two clans become allies, even more than when Jacob was pining for Bella - since he actually imprints on Nessie and the shapeshifters are forbidden from harming any shapeshifter's imprint.
</li><li> Nessie is also also <em>also</em> the catalyst for Bella becoming a vampire, which gives Bella the ability to use her new-and-improved mental shield to protect <em>everyone</em> on her side of the fight with the Volturi, so the Volturi cannot harm them. Thus the battle for which vampires have been gathering from all over the globe ends in a polite discussion before everyone goes home.

Frank assumes that if Scarlett has a baby, she'll be the sweet, loving woman with whom he fell in love. He's wrong, of course, given that the whole thing was just an act to snag him. Then, after she and Rhett marry, he admits that he had hoped that their marriage might work out after she gave birth to their daughter, and even after the relationship has effectively died, states that with Bonnie there, there could have still been some semblance of happiness. Later, when Scarlett learns she's pregnant again, for the first time ever, she's happy about it and sees the pregnancy as a chance for her and Rhett to reconcile, and after Bonnie's death, she admits that she'll have another child if that will bring him out of his grief.

</li><li> Torn apart in <em>Such A Pretty Girl</em> by Laura Wiess. A pedophile is let out of jail on a reduced sentence and suggests to his wife they have another child. She agrees, not because she wants a baby, but because <em>he</em> does, and she thinks it would be a wonderful symbol of their family starting over. Their fifteen-year-old daughter Meredith, one of her father's victims, is understandably horrified. Her narration later also references how foolish, but common, this idea is for 'girls like her'.

After months of traveling (subjective time) the stars and seeing many planets, she decides that she wants to give him a baby, something only one other woman has done before - his very first wife on Earth 20,000 years ago. Despite his arguments (perfectly valid) about the problems of having a fetus develop in a low-gravity environment and the lonely life he or she would have aboard the ship, she still wants a baby. Finally, she comes up with a solution - French drops her off on a planet where native women have prophetic powers that allow them to choose their soulmate (this would keep French's wife from cheating), and she has a son that will grow up and get married on the planet. She would then return to the ship decades later from her time frame but only months for French. The problem ignored by the author is that this means that French himself never even meets his son until decades later, so she's not really giving him a child. French mentions that there are whole groups of women he likes to call the Frenetic Mothers. Their only goal in life is to bear as many babies as possible. Who the fathers are doesn't really matter. They are the driving force behind human colonization of the galaxy, urging planetary governments to build colony ships whenever population density warrants <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopulationControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopulationControl">Population Control</a>.

Early on in the series, Katniss makes it clear that she has no interest in bringing children into a world where they have any chance of winding up fighting to the death in the eponymous Hunger Games. The epilogue indicates that she thinks the world has improved enough that having kids could be worth it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> That said, it still took the violent destruction of the tyrannical regime that ran the games and fifteen years on top of that for Peeta to convince her to have children.

The main characters, Karl Oskar and Kristina, are peasant farmers who decide to emigrate because they aren't able to support their growing family on the small farm where they live. Once in America they begin to prosper (to a degree - they never become <em>rich</em> but their standard of living certainly approves) and after a few years they can easily support their children, but having a new baby ever couple of years is still not easy. Karl Oskar and Kristina love their children very much and as the kids grow older they are able to help out at the farm and running the household. On the other hand, by the time they begin to prosper they've already had six children (though not all survive childhood) and every new baby means spreading their meagre supplies even thinner. There's a heartbreaking part before they emigrate when they've had another year of bad harvest and Kristina is devastated to see her children go hungry and wants to give her share of the food to them, only she can't because she has a new baby to nurse. It kills her inside to have to essentially take food from her starving children so that she can in turn feed the youngest. There's also a part of the story where she gives birth to a baby boy a few months after arriving in America, wherein the arrival of a new child could not have come at a worse time yet Kristina is beside herself with joy over her new baby.

It doesn't work: the adoption is denied and he and his wife eventually divorce.
</li><li> Subverted with cruel elegance on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen">Mad Men</a></em>.

Their marriage does seem to improve for a while, but eventually things fall apart after (1) Betty starts falling for another man (Henry Francis, an adviser to Governor Nelson Rockefeller) and (2) she finds out who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPersonImpersonation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPersonImpersonation">Don really is</a>. Fourteen months after Betty finds out about her pregnancy, she's flying out to Nevada (with Henry and baby Eugene) to file for divorce.
</li><li> Beautifully subverted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OutrageousFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OutrageousFortune">Outrageous Fortune</a></em>. Loretta, who is twisted and spiteful of just about everything before getting pregnant, gives birth (in an equally beautiful subversion of another aspect of this trope, where Van is the only one with her and visibly freaked out but still helping her), names the baby, and breastfeeds at least once and doesn't change a bit. She does undergo a radical change in the following season but, if anything, she only gets more evil, and there are other obvious reasons. Specifically, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the influence of her grandmother, Rita, and her desire to go after the then-boy now-old man Rita had an affair with</span>.

The baby did not make anything better. The one bright spot is that they might have been reunited in the end after Victor/Tony throws away the tech to be a father to T and, presumably, a husband to Sierra/Priya.
</li><li> Averted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em>. Kima's girlfriend wants a baby, and Kima reluctantly goes along with it. The baby ends up making their relationship significantly worse, and they eventually break up because of it. (And that's even despite the fact that Kima comes to love the baby.)
</li><li> Sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoked</a> in the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a></em>, where a single birth shows there is still hope for mankind. Takes a darker turn in Season 2 when the religious lobby (led by the Quorum member from Gemenon) and genuine concerns about population cause President Roslin (after a lot of wrestling with herself, as she seems to have been liberal on the subject before the Destruction of the Colonies) outlaws <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodGirlsAvoidAbortion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodGirlsAvoidAbortion">abortion</a>, a controversial decision that cost her some of her political popularity and gave Baltar's campaign against her a popularity surge.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Degrassi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Degrassi">Degrassi</a></em> usually inverts this: Manny and Liberty's pregnancies made everything worse. Especially Liberty's. Mia doesn't have any problem having a daughter, though, to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a> territory. (Although both Mia and Spike from teh original Degrassi High series have pretty supportive families). And Emma thought she was pregnant, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation">Alternative Character Interpretation</a> has it that she faked the pregnancy so Sean would stay with her.
</li><li> In the Korean drama <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LieToMeSK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LieToMeSK">Lie To Me</a></em>, this almost comes out of nowhere and the serious problems that the couple has suddenly evaporate.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Flashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Flashpoint">Flashpoint</a></em>:
<ul><li> Deconstructed in an where a couple trying to get pregnant only increased their frustrations on each other, leading the husband to sleep with another woman <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> though he realized his mistake and remained loyal to his wife</span>. And his adultery led to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the woman he slept with to become pregnant</span>. Once his already suspicious wife found out, things only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">got worse.</a>
</li><li> Also deconstructed with Jules and Sam. On her first day of work after finding out, they decided that everything will be fine and no one needed to know yet. But throughout the episode, both of them were having minor freakouts such as Sam calling Jules just to check up on her and Jules quietly panicking when Sam got close to a man holding C-4. They decide to tell the team by the end of the episode.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope was implicit in the resolution of one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">30 Rock</a></em>. Liz plots to adopt the baby of a woman she finds working the night shift in a bakery, and works to gain the mother's trust by giving her a job on TGS to "gauge the interests of young people." Pete calls her out on this manipulative behavior, saying that he freaked out several times whenever his wife got pregnant, but always came back. When the boyfriend does end up coming back, Pete's position is vindicated. From the audience perspective, though, whether either of these two are fit to be parents is a legitimate question considering how naive and overly romantic they are.
</li><li> This is subverted on an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami">CSI: Miami</a></em>. The carjacking and near-fatal beating of a pregnant woman was orchestrated by her husband who believed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreAWaste" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreAWaste">Children Are a Waste</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixteenAndPregnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixteenAndPregnant">16 and Pregnant</a></em>, this trope is usually proven false, with pregnancies causing breakups and dropping out of school.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em>: Skyler is pregnant when Walt is diagnosed with cancer, and his drug operation is motivated by the hope of providing a future for his family.

</li><li> Played with, but ultimately averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office</a></em>, where Michael's discovery of Jan's pregnancy brings him back together with her after their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardAbuseFemaleOnMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardAbuseFemaleOnMale">messy, domestic-violence induced breakup</a>. Ultimately averted in that the baby was not Michael's (it was an artificial insemination from a donor), and Jan told Michael that from the beginning, but it took until the baby was born for that fact to really sink in for him, then he stopped associating with Jan permanently.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em>:

</li><li> Averted with Baby William, even though Scully really wanted to be a mother. Having a baby made her and Mulder's lives a million times more complicated. She finds out she's pregnant at possibly the worst time in the series and things do not get much better from there. Her pregnancy is complicated by various health issues. The baby turns out to be a human/alien hybrid and essential in the conspiracy she and Mulder have been uncovering for the last eight years. As a result, those around her either want to kill the baby or kidnap and <em>then</em> kill him. There are several attempts on his life before and after his birth. She ends up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> giving him up for adoption</span> to an anonymous family to protect him.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixFeetUnder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixFeetUnder">Six Feet Under</a></em>: Nate and Lisa's relationship is at least as rocky after having a baby as before, and Nate actually breaks up with Brenda after getting her all knocked up.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneLifeToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneLifeToLive">One Life to Live</a></em>, when a woman suggests to her husband that they adopt another baby in addition to the child they adopted several years ago. Although she initially tries to play her idea as simply feeling ready for another child, the husband forces her to confront her real motives—their marriage is in trouble and she thinks another baby will solve their problems.
<ul><li> Even earlier in regards to the first child they adopted, which was spurred by her grief over the stillbirth of their son.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Maury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Maury">Maury</a></em> show uses the inversion of this trope pretty frequently. There will be episodes where a bunch of teenage girls act like they can become a great mother and how they have what it takes to raise a baby. Cue a reality check when the girls are sent somewhere to raise a baby for a few days and come to the realization on how hard babies make everything in life.
</li><li> A variant on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl">My Name Is Earl</a></em>. Joy becomes pregnant for the second time, and Earl is excited to be a father. Problem is, he's <em>not</em> the father; Joy had an affair with Darnell, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChocolateBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChocolateBaby">the truth came out 9 months later</a>. Earl is (understandably) crushed, and plans to leave Joy. He really has nowhere to go, so he heads back to his parents' house, intending to live there permanently and forget all about Joy, the kids, and the affair. Earl's dad convinces him to go back, if only for Dodge and Earl Jr., and Earl realizes his dad's right. He goes back to his family and does his best to provide for them (even if that usually involves stealing.) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Until the day Joy divorces Earl <em>while he's hospitalized</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">to be with Darnell.</a></span>

</li><li> Deconstructed in another episode: Earl reveals that (somewhere between the ages of 12 and 14), he had a crush on his babysitter, but found out she already had a boyfriend. He was jealous, and searched through the boyfriend's wallet, intending to take his money, but then he found a condom. Earl poked holes in the condom, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButWeUsedACondom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButWeUsedACondom">rendering it completely ineffective</a>, and naturally (as per the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfInverseFertility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfInverseFertility">Law of Inverse Fertility</a>) the babysitter became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy">pregnant</a>. She apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunWedding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunWedding">married her boyfriend</a> (and gave birth at the wedding reception), and though they are still together and happy as can be, their son (now an adult) is an ungrateful loser.

Earl decides to teach him how to be more mature...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> though it's actually <em>Randy</em> that ends up doing it.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Painfully subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey">Downton Abbey</a></em>: both <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sybil and Matthew die</span> on the day their children are born.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrincessReturningPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrincessReturningPearl">Princess Returning Pearl</a></em> series 3, when the birth of his child by Zhi Hua does not make the situation better for Yong Qi at all.

Obviously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">it didn't work</a>, as they were divorced by the time the series began (less than 10 years later), but they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmicableExes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmicableExes">still remained good friends.</a> They discuss this because they planned to have another baby together because Old Christine was jealous that New Christine (Richard's new girlfriend) was having a baby, though they realized that having a baby for the wrong reasons was a very bad idea.

Justified as they'd longed for children for years, fought very hard to get them, and are both mature characters who are totally prepared and capable of raising a family together. Plus they were already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a>, so it's not that children were fixing their marriage - just giving them what they'd always wanted.
