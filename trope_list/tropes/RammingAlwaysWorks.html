</p><p>This is, in fact, pretty credible. The impact of a heavy freight train going 60 mph is equal to that of 1 to 2 tons of TNT — it's just over a much smaller area, and going in one direction. Most spaceships are far heavier, and can go far faster. An object traveling at 3 km/sec does damage equal to its own weight in TNT<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0i8y0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0i8y0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0i8y0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Among hard SF enthusiasts, this is known as Rick Robinson's Law of Space Combat. An object impacting at 6 km/sec would do damage equal to 4 times its weight in TNT, and would be said to do "4 Ricks" worth of damage.</span>; a spaceship traveling at 94% of the speed of light does damage equal to its own weight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antimatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antimatter">antimatter</a></em>. And that's not even taking into account the ramming ship detonating its reactors and munitions when it hits.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In fact, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics">usual mistake</a> is not to make ramming work too well but to make it work <em>not well enough</em>. Survivors are not unknown, and the effect is usually depicted as "Ship A crashes into ship B and ship B crumples and breaks apart in slow motion," where it should look like, and is only rarely is portrayed as, "Ship A crashes into ship B and both ships are vaporized in a titanic fireball". Likewise, small fighter craft often smash into bigger ships with no visible effect, when they ought to be wreaking massive devastation.
</p><p>And then there's the momentum, even ramming at a few tens of meters per second could create enough force for the people in at least one of the ships to slam into the walls at speeds high enough to kill or injure them. Though interestingly when one of the ships weighs a lot more than the other the people in the bigger ship might only be knocked off their feet, so for a bigger ship ramming into a much smaller one at 10-30 m/s could be a great tactic for taking out enemy crews while leaving both ships intact...
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>That said, there <em>is</em> one challenge for a ramming ship, which is reaching the target in the first place. At realistic space combat distances (hundreds if not thousands of kilometers), the target should have plenty of time to see the attempt coming and either blow up the ramming ship or dodge out of its way. This ought to lead to a tense cat-and-mouse game as the rammer tries to close the distance and compensate for the target's evasive maneuvers, and the target tries to stay clear long enough to score a killing hit — the ramming ship is essentially a large missile, and the target would be performing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSpeedMissileDodge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSpeedMissileDodge">High-Speed Missile Dodge</a>. Sadly, things are never portrayed like this.
</p><p>The reason for this, of course, is that space ramming depictions are probably based on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsAnOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsAnOcean">Space Is an Ocean</a> mindset, and the cultural memory of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HistoryOfNavalWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HistoryOfNavalWarfare">naval tactics</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome">ancient</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece">world</a>. Before the advent of cannons, ramming the other ships was the main method for taking them out (other than burning or boarding). Note that this is where the term "ramming speed" comes from — the horator would begin beating the drums faster so the rovers at the oars of the galleys rowed faster in order to drive the ram deep into the side of the enemy ship. Ramming tactics made a brief comeback in the latter half of the nineteenth century, with steamships, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">they started making ships out of metal instead of wood</a> which made older cannons obsolete. Even then, battleships continued to be built with bows designed for ramming for many years after the tactic ceased to be relevant. In fact, in the early years of ironclad battleships, their armor was so effective against the relatively primitive guns of the era that ramming was seen as the only viable tactic against an ironclad. Even past this point, many ships have done a LOT of damage to each other with accidental or deliberate ramming, in particular sinking a large number of surfaced submarines.

<ul><li> During the final battle the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar">Outlaw Star</a></em> rams the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> <em>twice</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the second time killing him for good</span>. Of course this is somewhat justified by the <em>Outlaw Star</em> being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">powered by the Galactic Leyline. Or course, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> was powered by it too, but he's evil, so it's OK</span>. Also justified by the fact that the ships are designed for close combat in general. They have arms and fight with giant knives on occasion.
</li><li> Vincent Alzey of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LastExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LastExile">Last Exile</a></em> seemed to prefer this maneuver in his battle against the <em>Silvana</em>. However, the captain of the <em>Silvana</em>, Alex Rowe, expected such a tactic. It helps that the <em>Urbanus</em>-class ships are equipped with a gigantic, reinforced spike on their bows, and extend wing-like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainsawGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainsawGood">chainsaws</a> from the sides. The ships are made explicitly for ramming, which is what Alex was counting on.
</li><li> Vincent uses a similar trick in the sequel series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LastExileFamTheSilverWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LastExileFamTheSilverWing">Last Exile: Fam, the Silver Wing</a></em> as well.

</li><li> That tactic was also used sometimes by Tetsuya Tsurugi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger">Great Mazinger</a></em> and Duke Fleed from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFORoboGrendizer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFORoboGrendizer">UFO Robo Grendizer</a></em> (in fact, one of the CMOA of <em>UFO Robo Grendizer</em> happened one of the times Duke used that stratagem). Flying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast">Robeasts</a> in those series often attempting to ram the enemy, too.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CombattlerV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CombattlerV">Combattler V</a></em>, the Choudenji Spin — ramming through the enemy — is often used like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Move</a>. Combattler uses the Choudenji Tatsumaki — paralyzing the enemy by blasting it with a stream of electricity — and then rams through its adversary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpectacularSpinning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpectacularSpinning">as spinning endlessly</a>. That movement tends to leave a nice gaping hole in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em>:
<ul><li> The team's <em>flying battleship with legs</em> rams into one of the four generals' personal Gunmen, as well as their capital ship; the former is successful due to the <em>sheer</em> difference in size, while the other works because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>. The battleship's main body is essentially a giant blade.

</li><li> <em>Lagann-hen</em> takes it to the logical extreme. In the series, the Moon tried to crash into Earth but didn't really do anything else. In the movie, the Moon transforms into the Cathedral Lazengann as soon as its defenders are gone then tries to punch the Earth in a unique take on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">Colony Drop</a>.

The maneuver falls out of use when the enemy provokes it in order to launch a boarding operation (and a little friendly fire incident). But still, not bad for something thought up in the middle of the battle it's first used in...
<ul><li> Its use in "Love Drifts Away"/"Force of Arms" takes it one step further. After completing the Maneuver above with it's whole body, the SDF-1 then activates its full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeehiveBarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeehiveBarrier">Beehive Barrier</a> shield.

<ul><li> One mission in the "Just Another Day" parody series of missions had fun with this. A corvette "blockades" a jump node by sitting <em>right next to it</em> so incoming ships will ram it and blow themselves up before they can steer away from it. After one hilarious example, another ship jumps out in a different vector, avoiding the corvette completely, leading its commander to ask, "Can they do that?"
</li><li> To add to this, the second mission of JAD Episode 1 sends the <em>Colossus Reborn</em> to attack a Sathanas that jumps in near the end of the mission. When the <em>Colossus Reborn</em> arrives, its subspace vortex is <em>just in front of the Sathanas.</em> Guess what happens to both ships?
</li><li> The campaign <em>Ridiculous</em> also shares a mission featuring ships (A Colossus that you win <em>through a lottery</em>) jumping into another ship. As before, neither survive.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Derelict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Derelict">Derelict</a></em> campaign, this is how the GTVA takes down the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>SD Nyarlathotep</em>, using a corvette rigged with as many high-yield Meson bombs as could be jammed into the hull</span>. This conveniently bypasses the target's superior firepower and durability, which the Alliance has thus far been unable to overcome in a straight fight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentThreatReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentThreatReborn">Silent Threat: Reborn</a></em>, a fan remake of the (generally considered below the standards of the other games) official expansion <em>Silent Threat</em>, zig-zags it.

Then the engines come back online, letting <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Hades</span> jump to another system... where it is subsequently revealed that despite that the ramming actually <em>did</em> do catastrophic damage to the engines, allowing GTA forces to catch up and engage the ship.

In a pinch, and when dealing with ships neither as durable or as large as the freighter, ramming becomes an option too.

Ramming the <em>Enterprise</em> directly into the Reman Warbird <em>Scimitar</em> is made more impressive by the fact that a previous torpedo attack had breached the armor over the bridge shell, exposing the interior of the <em>Enterprise</em> bridge to open space (leading to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a> moment). Fairly "realistic" given that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">both ships are completely fucked by the impact</span>. To take it to another extreme, the <em>Scimitar</em> then fired reverse thrusters and backed out of the wreckage and was <em>still able to attack</em>!

After blowing out the bridge's front panel, he brought his ship into a place where it <em>could</em> be rammed, and then froze up when Picard began to accelerate towards him.

<ul><li> In the JJ Abrams movie, this happens not once but twice, with the <em>Kelvin</em> and then the <em>Jellyfish</em> ramming the <em>Narada</em>. It being <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless">the shields do nothing</a> and the ramming attempts are successful, though both attempts fail to destroy the ship directly. It's rather big, after all. The novelization of the film reveals that George Kirk activated the warp drive just prior to impact, causing even more damage and disrupting plenty of systems of the <em>Narada</em>. This is why the Klingons were able to get the drop on them shortly after. But that just raises the question of why the <em>Kelvin</em> didn't just try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspeedEscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspeedEscape">warp out of there</a>.
</li><li> In a similar instance, the saucer section of a destroyed Federation ship clips the nacelle of the <em>Enterprise</em>, scraping off some plating as though the shields aren't even there. Think about it, energy shields might be able to stop small energy fire and torpedo fires, but it won't do squat against giant spaceships with huge momentum behind them.

The pilot, Arvel Crynyd, had been hit seconds before by defensive fire and had a critically damaged fighter. He thus decided to take as much down with him as he could, which ended up being quite a lot.

</div></li></ul><dl><dt></dt><dd> This example subverts the usual flaws with the trope, as this single fighter ship's impact causes catastrophic and immediate damage to the much larger ship beyond simply killing the people on the bridge.
</dd></dl><ul><li> The script and novelization refer to ships ramming Star Destroyers, either having been loaded with explosives beforehand, or because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">they were dying already and aimed to eliminate an enemy Star Destroyer by either ramming them or exploding next to them</a>.

Hobbie survived more or less intact by ejecting right before, but Veers lost his legs. This was also supposed to happen in the film, but the footage was cut.
</li><li> Subverted first in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em>, though. Wedge's rescue of Luke involved lunging straight at the enemy TIE Fighter with guns blazing. The theatrically-released remastered movie shows Wedge shooting <em>through</em> the collapsing enemy ship. Note that in the book, that was Biggs, not Wedge. It's not the only film/book discrepancy; the novelization was finished well before the film was. Also (justifiably) averted, when several fighters are shown to crash into the Death Star without destroying it; their relative sizes make this completely understandable.

The <em>Lancelot</em> has other ideas, though, and ejects the captain's pod as well seconds before the impact.

It's not given how small the corvette was, but the people on the bridge of the 485-meter UNSC Destroyer <em>Iroquois</em> "barely felt the bump", while the corvette was fatally damaged. In an earlier battle above the same planet, Keyes does a variant of this move. He doesn't as much as ram an enemy destroyer as much as he did scrape it, but it was enough for him to fire the Archer missiles on the <em>Iroquois</em> to seriously damage the destroyer at nearly point-blank as Keyes led a homing plasma shot that had been track the <em>Iroquois</em> back at the destroyer. Results were lethal and the maneuver was named <a class="urllink" href="http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Keyes_Loop">the "Keyes Loop"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. While his ram of the opposing destroyer was enough to let him beat it, once he got back to spacedock and took a look at the ship he realized that "A few more degrees of tilt down and he would have sheared his own craft in two."

In a zone of slipspace where all weapons fired would veer off in random directions, Admiral Whitcomb took out one enemy ship not by firing his weapons, but instead by locating the wreck of an enemy ship, and pushing it at max speed towards a Covenant ship, while reversing as soon as the mass had enough velocity. Destruction ensued. Subverted near the ending, where Whitcomb's ship is used to ram into an enemy base several hundred times bigger than the ship itself, but causing little serious damage. However, the true goal was to lure all Covenant ships near that base into close proximity... as the base's fusion systems had been sabotaged minutes before by a team of Spartans, resulting in a nuclear blast that wiped out all 500 enemy ships, as well as, sadly, Whitcomb's ship.

The Theban fanatics used their "Ramming Fleet" of specialized suicide cruisers solely as a last-ditch option against superior technology and numbers. The Arachnids, a remorseless hive species with no concern for individual unit survival whatsoever, used suicide-piloted fighters, shuttles, and gunboats (all loaded to the brim with antimatter!) as <em>routine ordnance</em>. In Insurrection, A badly damaged super-dreadnought deliberately rams a super-monitor in the final battle. The resultant explosion is so dramatic both sides of the battle call an immediate ceasefire that ultimately ends the war.

Picard even phrases the order as "Ramming speed!" and tilts <em>Enterprise</em> relative to the Romulan ship so the saucer hull acts like an axe blade to cut the Warbird's "head" off.

The narrator soon remarks that it would be easier to list the parts of the <em>Enterprise</em> that <em>weren't</em> damaged by the maneuver.
</li><li> The novel <em>The Return</em> ups the ante a bit, with a <em>Defiant</em>-class ship executing a tricky maneuver that leaves it <em>between a </em>D'deridex<em>-class Warbird's twin hulls</em>.

<ul><li> Subverted in <em>Force Heretic III</em> in the same series. The villains try to ram the hero's flagship, only to be vaporized before they can make contact (probably a first for the Star Wars Universe).
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkEmpire">Dark Empire</a></em> series, the reborn Emperor Palpatine has a new superweapon: the <em>Eclipse</em>, a new class of Super Star Destroyer modeled after sea-faring warships of eras long past. The front of the ship is extra-reinforced and the shields are boosted, allowing the titanic battleship to ram into and through other ships without hesitation or damage. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The New Republic takes advantage of this in order to eliminate the Empire's other, even deadlier superweapon, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterstellarWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterstellarWeapon">Galaxy Gun</a>. Since a direct attack against the heavily-guarded Galaxy Gun would be doomed, instead they kill two birds with one stone by hacking the <em>Eclipse</em> nav computer and programming it to ram the Galaxy Gun.

The Saga Edition of Starships of the Galaxy refers to a Corellian Corvette doing this, but the Rebels weren't lacking for suicidal actions that day.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JediAcademyTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JediAcademyTrilogy">Jedi Academy Trilogy</a></em>, Ackbar takes over remote control of a partially-completed MC90 Star Cruiser and rams it into an Imperial Star Destroyer attacking the shipyards. Both ships are obliterated.
<ul><li> Also done in the previous book. Han, Chewie, and Kyp Durron have stolen the Sun Crusher from the Maw Installation and a star destroyer moves to block their path out of the black hole cluster.

The speeding alien ship slams into the expanding cloud of water and is crushed due to the huge velocity differential.

The rammed ship is captured, repaired, and seen back in service in later books. Mayhew's ship isn't so lucky — it's damaged beyond repair and will never take a wormhole jump again. This means Mayhew's jumping career is over, since his neural implant is incompatible with any other ship. But the most important consequence is that Miles and his people are stuck in the system until they can find another ship and pilot to take them elsewhere — forcing them to sign up for the rest of the story.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVorGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVorGame">The Vor Game</a></em>, Miles muses that with the ongoing R&amp;D war between offensive and defensive weaponry causing the effective range of ship to ship weapons to be getting shorter and shorter, some military strategists are beginning to think that ramming might actually be becoming an effective tactic.

And they somehow manage to be slightly <em>less</em> overtly Freudian than the ship the protagonists are in.
</li><li> An accidental example in one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarCarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarCarrier">Star Carrier</a></em> books, where a Russian ship ends up slamming at a North American one, when the joint fleet comes out of metaspace. Normally, the AIs of ships coordinate their arrival to prevent such accidents, but the AIs of different nations haven't had much chance to work together yet, and their protocols ended up not meshing well. The resulting explosion vaporized both ships and produces a multi-megaton explosion. At those speeds, it doesn't matter that one ship was much smaller than the other.
</li><li> Used in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy">Horus Heresy</a></em> novel <em>Know No Fear</em> as a prelude to the Word Bearers' invasion of Calth.

All it does is get the pilot killed and slow down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> somewhat. It is established earlier that Chiggy's fighter has stronger-than-normal armor.
<ul><li> It may be stronger, but Chiggy still goes down from one missile, when the human's own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">ace</a> goes after it (alone) in an ordinary Hammerhead. It helps that the human ace is not entirely human (a genetically-engineered worker/soldier).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>:
<ul><li> Attempted by Hammond and the <em>Prometheus</em> in the season 7 finale with the expectation of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> (the shields of the <em>Prometheus</em> are down, and if it's possible to survive a collision in orbit in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse">Stargate-verse</a> at all, Earth's technology isn't that far along at this point), but the enemy ship is destroyed before the <em>Prometheus</em> can hit it.
</li><li> Subverted in the season 10 opener. Bra'tac attempts to destroy an Ori mothership by ramming it with a Goa'uld mothership. The Ori ship is bigger and has much more powerful shields, so the Goa'uld ship crashes rather pathetically on the shield, causing no damage whatsoever.
</li><li> And then of course there's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Ancients</a>. After much testing, they decided the best ship-to-ship weapons they could build were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">swarms</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack">shield-piercing</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone">attack drones</a> that fought by smashing into things at high speed.
</li></ul></li><li> Using ships to ram structures on the ground is pretty popular in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>:
<ul><li> When the Wraith's first attack on Atlantis begins to sour, the cruisers jump into hyperspace to call reinforcements while the Darts (fighters) make a kamikaze run for the city, hoping to destroy it kinetically. Fortunately, Atlantis's team manages to raise the city's shield in time.
</li><li> The team has a Wraith Hive ship with damaged weapons and needs to disable a Wraith cloning facility on the planet below. Originally, their plan is to either steal or overload the ZPMs powering the facility, but an attacking Hive ship encourages them to use their captured Hive ship to disable the facility a little more... <em>thoroughly</em>.
</li><li> Todd steals the <em>Daedalus</em> to destroy a machine that turns Wraith ships entering hyperspace into mincemeat (the Attero Device). When Ronon realizes Wraith have captured the ship, he starts blasting the control crystals of various systems, including weapons. Guess how Todd decides to destroy the facility when they arrive... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He is thankfully thwarted, but by all indications it would have worked.</span>
</li><li> A rare ship-to-ship example: in "The Last Man", an alternate reality Carter rams a Wraith Hiveship with the <em>Phoenix</em>, a much smaller 304 Battlecruiser. The <em>Phoenix</em> not only destroys the Hiveship, but two more are destroyed when they get caught in the blast of the first. Of course, the <em>Phoenix</em> is about to explode at the time.
</li><li> This is the standard operating procedure for drone attacks. The Ancients' bread and butter weapon is the Attack Drone, a strangely squid-shaped missile that glows bright yellow when armed, and will fly through a target several times, boring neatly carved bore-holes through it before it eventually runs out of energy or the target is destroyed and the drone recovered for re-use. Capital-grade drone systems combine this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">Macross Missile Massacre</a> for dazzling effect.
</li><li> Final example in the last episode of the series: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">during the Wraith attack of Earth, a pair of Darts escapes the F-302 squadron and crash into the main Area 51 complex, destroying the Ancient control chair brought back from Antarctica, depriving the planet of its last line of defense</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Stargate Universe</a></em>, the remote-controlled drone fighters, upon learning that <em>Destiny</em> has adapted to their weapons, turn to this trope as an alternative. Thankfully for <em>Destiny</em>, it is really big, the drones are very small, and their shields hold up long enough to destroy the Control Ship. Later they remote-pilot a shuttle into a Control Ship whilst simultaneously detonating its reactors, destroying both ships.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens so much in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> it's probably required reading at the Academy. No matter the situation, ramming is almost always more effective than weapons at causing damage.
<ul><li> The <em>Enterprise's</em> second encounter with the Borg in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>, "The Best of Both Worlds": In the absence of any other way of stopping the Borg from assimilating Earth, Riker ordered Wesley to aim the ship at the Borg cube, and go to maximum warp. (It's unclear exactly what happens when a ship in warp hits a solid object, but at a minimum a forced collapse of the warp field would be tres chaotic.) Fortunately, this proves unnecessary.
</li><li> The Borg themselves seem to be a fan of this. During the brief scenes of the Battle of Wolf 359, the invading Borg Cube encounters a fleet of Starfleet ships and doesn't even bother to slow down. Literally. Their beam weapon destroys the saucer section of the USS <em>Melbourne</em> and then the Cube simply rams the wreck instead of moving around it.
</li><li> The Dominion of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> employ suicide ramming tactics to destroy Federation ships; specifically, the destruction of the USS <em>Odyssey</em>. They also take down multiple Klingon ships using this tactic during the Dominion War. In <em>Odyssey's</em> case the ship was already withdrawing, but the Jem'Hadar rammed it anyway, just to show how serious they were.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> episode "The Year of Hell", Janeway destroys Annorax's temporal incursion ship (a starship built around a weapon that literally <em>erases things from time</em>) by crashing the crippled <em>Voyager</em> into it. Which would have ended the series, except that, by ramming the ship, the catastrophic damage Janeway inflicted caused it to erase <em>itself</em> from existence, pressing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> on the entire year and for everything Annorax erased with it before.
</li><li> Even the Borg resort to this once on an episode of <em>Voyager</em>. To save <em>Voyager</em> (actually the modified nanoprobes on <em>Voyager</em>), a Borg cube slams itself into a comparatively tiny Species 8472 bioship, destroying both ships.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery">Star Trek: Discovery</a></em>, T'Kuvma's people build a "cleave ship", a giant vessel with a massive sharp prow. The ship is cloaked for much of the Battle of the Binary Stars, then rams into the USS <em>Europa</em>, starting to cut the ship in two. The crew self-destructs the <em>Europa</em>, taking the cleave ship with them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Another one appears during the final battle of season 2, cleaving through several Section 31 ships before decloaking and engaging them with conventional weapons. It also serves as Chancellor L'Rell's flagship for this battle, with the D7s arriving less than a minute later to engage the enemy.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Almost happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EarthFinalConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EarthFinalConflict">Earth: Final Conflict</a></em>, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts">Ma'el</a>'s ship is discovered and reactivated. The protagonists discover a living human (and a Roman to boot) aboard in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle">stasus pod</a>. The Roman ends up speaking flawless English, as he's been leapfrogging through history in order to see if the Taelons have arrived yet (the task Ma'el assigned him) and managed to learn the language during the last several awakenings. After questioning Liam and Renee about the Taelons, he determines that Ma'el's worst predictions have come true and engages the ship's final protocol, programmed by Ma'el. The ship lifts off and accelerates on a collision course with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMothership" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMothership">Taelon mothership</a>. With only minutes left, the mothership is too large to be moved out of the way so quickly. The collision would've destroyed both ships, but Liam manages to engage the ship's self-destruct, before getting into the stasis pod with Renee, correctly assuming that Ma'el would've programmed it to eject if the ship was threatened. The Roman is killed in the explosion, and the mothership is saved.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven">Blake's 7</a></em>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">    Tabletop Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder7" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Many ships of the Imperial Navy of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattlefleetGothic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattlefleetGothic">Battlefleet Gothic</a></em> are built with prows designed for ramming. All Ork vessels have armoured prows, spikes and so on for ramming, with one type of ship, named the "Brute" ram ship by the Imperial Navy, designed <em>specifically for ramming</em>. Consisting of a gigantic armoured prow, a powerful engine and minimal weaponry, they are one of the least subtle devices in the entire 40k universe, which is a truly, truly impressive feat.
<ul><li> The Cestus Assault Ram, as its name implies, is designed primarily to ram into enemy ships or fortresses and discharge its cargo of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines">Space Marines</a> inside. The ship is designed around a huge magna-melta that fires just before impact to soften up the surface.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> of the Astral Knights chapter involved ramming their <em>Tempestus</em> Battlebarge (a kilometre-long battleship) through the void shields of a Necron World Engine (imagine a Death Star possessed by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> and crewed by ancient skeletal death robots). After punching through its void shields, hundreds of Astral Knights spent hours battling across the surface of the World Engine, destroying everything that looked remotely important while beset on all sides by thousands of Necrons. Nearly wiped out to a man, the Chapter Master himself led a handful of survivors down into the bowels of the Engine and destroyed the main shield generators with melta-bombs, allowing the Imperial Navy to finish it off. And so the Astral Knights vanished into legend.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Battletech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Battletech">Battletech</a></em> setting, both the tabletop games and the <em>Mechwarrior</em> video game franchise, allows you to attempt "death from above" — that is, using jump jets to lift yourself into the air and then land on your opponent, Mario-style. It's very difficult to aim, but when it hits, it results on 70 odd tons of giant war robot landing on the enemy machine — usually, right on the cockpit. Squish.
<ul><li> The major reason for this is because the head is a 1 in 36 shot on the regular hit table (You need 12 on 2d6) however, the punch hit location table (Which is used for punches and DFA attacks) it's 1 in 6. Even if you miss the head, most of the vital components of a Battle Mech are in the torsos and arms. Taking out your opponent's weapons while knocking them on their ass is a very useful way to strike when you can survive it.
</li><li> In fact, one mech called the <em>Highlander</em> is specialized for this; the tactic is known as "Highlander Burial" when done by this mech.
</li><li> The boardgame also has charging rules for both 'Mechs and vehicles, allowing them to crash into each other at high speed under the right circumstances. The way the rules are set up, this usually tends to do rather more damage to the target than the attacker if done right. (This is deliberately unrealistic to make using this maneuver from time to time actually worthwhile.)
<ul><li> Incidentally, since 'Mechs are significantly taller than regular ground vehicles, the latter can charge the former (hitting the legs unless the target just happens to be prone) but not vice verse. A BattleMech can <em>kick</em> a vehicle or make a death-from-above attack against it...but not charge at it outright.
</li></ul></li><li> Also, in the background universe, there's the famous incident where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tyra Miraborg</span> rams her near-wrecked fighter into the enemy flagship and thereby brings the entire Clan invasion to a halt for a year. Possibly in something of an aversion, the <em>ship</em> survives the attack reasonably well, though with damage to the bridge — what stops the Clans is the death of their war-leader and the need to convene on their distant common homeworld to elect another.
</li><li> Late in the fiction line, this tactic became fairly common in warship combat, being featured in numerous novels.
<ul><li> Interestingly, the game rules themselves go out of their way to prevent this particular scenario from being commonplace. Among other factors, an aerospace unit trying to make a ramming attempt needs to roll dice to determine whether its pilot or crew is <em>actually crazy enough to go through with it</em> — on anything but an 11 or 12 on 2d6 (which is to say, in eleven cases out of twelve assuming fair dice), the attempt stops right there.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In hard sci-fi board game <em>Attack Vector Tactical</em>, ramming an enemy ship (if you hit) destroys it and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructiveCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructiveCharge">your own ship</a>. However, to be able to do this your crew has to be convinced to do it by the <em>player</em> making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech">speech the other players vote as suitably moving</a>. And if you manage to move another player to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears">tears</a>, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCreed">upgrades the level of one of your other ship's crew</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a>: Space</em>, ramming the enemy is the most powerful attack you have. It doesn't always work but the amount of damage is tremendous.
</li><li> An article in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Dragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Dragon">Dragon</a></em> described a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller">Traveller</a></em> player, only identified as "Bob", who "obviously assumed that starships and ancient galleys were built alike." His attempted ram ("I've got the bigger ship!") turned both ships into clouds of debris, much to his confusion.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarRealms">Star Realms</a></em> has the Blob <em>Ram</em>, which from the name and card art appears to employ the trope. Seems to be a prestigious position too, as Ram Pilots are one of the Blob Hero cards in the <em>Crisis</em> expansion.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StrikeLegion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StrikeLegion">Strike Legion</a></em>, not only is ramming a very powerful weapon in its own right, but ramming is outright <em>recommended</em> to deal with one species' ships that have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> shielding and armor. Keep in mind, this is a setting where the average military warship can ram a <em>planet</em> and <em>win</em>.

But ships can be equipped with "close-combat weapons" such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponizedExhaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponizedExhaust">vent re-directions</a> that can only be used after ramming.

The capital ships in this game have armor tough enough that the weapon of choice for destroying them is carpet-bombing with <em>antimatter</em> bombs, or enormous beam cannons that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">vaporize fighters</a> from a glancing blow; they are in general not harmed by collisions with other ships:
<ul><li> One mission ends when a destroyer of the rebellious Neo-Terran Front desperately attempts to ram the Alliance's new <em>Colossus</em> juggernaut. You have to try to disable or destroy it before it can impact. If you don't... well, it basically just goes <em>splat</em> against the aptly-named <em>Colossus</em> anyway, so it's no big deal.
</li><li> It is played straight in the game's predecessor, where the Hammer of Light cruiser <em>Mauler</em> attempts to ram the Terran flagship <em>Galatea</em>. Though it is possible to have defended the <em>Galatea</em> well enough to have it survive the impact, the <em>Mauler</em> still does ridiculously huge amounts of damage. Possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a>, though, as the game mentions the kamikaze fighters in that mission (and presumably the <em>Mauler</em>), are loaded with powerful explosives.

</li><li> A particularly devastating example of this trope in action is the Elemental Lord of the Wind, Cybuster, and its "Akashic Buster" attack.

The <em>Tarawa</em> wasn't destroyed by it, but given the make-shift nature of escort carriers, the destruction of the bridge did put a serious cramp in operations, in that unlike a purpose-built warship, the CVEs didn't have a Combat Information Center deep inside the ship where it would be safe from most damage that didn't outright kill the ship.

<ul><li> The buildup for the expansion "Empyrean Age" features tensions between the Gallente Federation and Caldari State reaching a boiling point after a Gallente Admiral rams his Mothership into a highly populated space station during an economic summit between the two empires. He succeeds despite the massive armada present having 4 minutes to shoot him down.
<ul><li> To be fair, most of that "armada" was fleeing civilian ships, and the video of the incident ran 22 seconds. A sizable chunk of the non-civilian chips were the Gallente escort, in discord as they realize what their own ship is doing, and the Caldari guards presumably don't have the backup or enough time to take down a mothership, the second-largest ship class in the universe. The novelization adds that the shield generators that could have saved the station were sabotaged.
</li></ul></li><li> Downplayed in actual gameplay. Ships colliding with each other do not inflict damage, and rebound off of each other like rubber balls. However, that bounce can still be used offensively: in order for a ship to use its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarpDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarpDrive">Warp Drive</a> to leave combat, it must be flying directly towards its destination at a decent speed. Bumping a ship throws off its heading, thus delaying its alignment and warp. In past years, bumping could be sustained indefinitely against larger ships, however in recent years it was changed so that a ship which got stuck trying to warp for several minutes could skip the alignment and warp anyway. Even so, bumping is still a critical piece of strategy for buying time when trying to kill larger ships, and the phrase "Don't bump the *** Titan" is a running joke and a reminder to newer pilots of what <em>not</em> to do to their allies in capital ships.
<ul><li> Bumping can also be used as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeTossingCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeTossingCharge">Foe-Tossing Charge</a>, either to push ships away from stargates or wormholes and prevent them from jumping out to safety, to push Sieged capital ships away from each other so they cannot support each other, or in areas where PVP is "illegal" to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Griefer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Griefer">shove mining ships away from their asteroids</a>.

</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Weird (and old) PC game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StratosphereConquestOfTheSkies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StratosphereConquestOfTheSkies">Stratosphere: Conquest of the Skies</a></em> has flying fortresses — essentially huge floating rocks with thrusters on top of which fixed units are built. Various and nasty are the instruments of death meant to make enemy fortresses lose their main sustainment building and plummet to the ground, but when weapons fail — and it does happen, since your enemies do not particularly like the idea of being swatted out of the air and react accordingly - it's often possible to just floor it and pray your fortress' ramming spikes are stronger than the other's walls. This causes inordinate amount of damage even when successful, but the fact that fortresses self-rebuild and repair given enough resources and time makes it a viable tactic.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkstarOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkstarOne">Darkstar One</a></em>, ramming is a valid tactic if you have plasma shield. If not, don't. You'll get hurt.
</li><li> Ramming is extremely destructive in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XUniverse">X Universe</a></em>. It frequently happens by accident, but a player in a fast capital ship or heavy transport can annihilate other capital ships or whole squadrons of fighters.
<ul><li> In <em>X-Tension</em>, enemy ships were known for their sudden turns. It's unclear whether the AI was actively trying to ram you or just doing evasive maneuvers that just happened to cross your path, but the result was almost always a kaboom — whether yours or theirs depended entirely on how much shielding the ships carried. The novelization of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XBeyondTheFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XBeyondTheFrontier">X: Beyond the Frontier</a></em>, to which <em>X-T</em> is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">pokes fun at this</a>:

</div></li><li> Accidental ramming is, fortunately, reduced in subsequent games of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X">X</a></em> series; however, since the player can pilot many more capital ships (ranging from small frigates to huge battlecruisers), <em>intentional</em> ramming takes a whole new meaning.
<ul><li> The big thing in <em>X3</em> is to ensure that when you hit the target, you've got more shields than they do. Thus, ramming is the fastest way to clear fighter swarms if you're in a capital ship (just swing the nose around like a fly-swatter), and it's the fastest way to commit suicide if you're flying a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">scoutship</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> By using the tractor beam (which first appeared in <em>X3: Reunion</em>), the player can grapple/tow capital ships or entire stations behind them, and can sling them around to bash things, though very awkwardly. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">script</a> allows the player to grapple <em>anything</em> - including enemies - and makes the tractor beam very predictable, allowing you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu">swing around ore mines or battleships like a hammer</a>.

<ul><li> You can destroy at least one enemy ship with it; it does a fair chunk of hull damage, so if you have the enemy shields down and yours are up, it's quite useful.

</li></ul></li><li> Multiple subversions are in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> turn-based strategy game <em>Birth of the Federation</em>. In the game's simulated ship-to-ship combat, you can order your ships to ram an enemy vessel, thereby bypassing the shields and attacking the hull directly. As your orders play out, your ships will open fire with everything they have, trying (and sometimes managing) to destroy their target before they ram into it. The ram order, however, leaves your ships unable to avoid enemy fire, potentially allowing them to be destroyed before they can even get close. Finally, when a weaker ship successfully rams a more powerful (re: has more hit points) ship, they only do about as much damage as they have hull strength — ramming a 1000-hp battleship with a 20-hp scout just won't cut it.
<ul><li> This is however an excellent way to deal with The Borg. They have incredible shields but weak hull. Ramming ignores shields. You'll still lose a <em>LOT</em> of ships doing it, but not as many as fighting it. One of the few games where a Borg cube appearing is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> moment.
<ul><li> Also a worthwhile strategy for the Ferengi, who can afford thicker hulls.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The bigger ships in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> <em>Starfleet Academy</em> could be used effectively this way. It'd usually still hurt but could finish off or cripple a smaller ship. Combined with cloaking devices on some ships, you could pull off a completely stealth ramming with some luck.
<ul><li> If you weren't careful though, even if your ship survived you might end up losing a warp nacelle or two. In the storyline mode this was an automatic failure, as finishing the mission required returning to the starbase, which required warp drive.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBattlefront" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBattlefront">Star Wars: Battlefront</a></em> and its sequel, ramming enemy vehicles with yours causes no damage. At least not until you fix a mine or two on the front. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">Kaboom, yo!</a>
<ul><li> However, in the first game ramming enemy infantry in a speeder bike kills the enemy while doing no damage to the biker, but ramming anything else in the bike kills the biker. Interestingly enough, ramming a shielded destroyer droid with a speeder bike kills both the droid and the biker.
<ul><li> Playing this trope even more straight, ramming a Hero in the first game (where they were unplayable but had unlimited health) with a Speeder Bike is one of the only ways to successfully deal with them.
</li></ul></li><li> In the space maps in the sequel ramming does do damage and can actually be used effectively by players. Parked starfighters take more damage than flying ones for some reason, meaning that players can still do damage in enemy hangars. Ramming a bomber into a landing ship in your own hangar can also destroy it much faster than shoulder-launched rockets. Fighters can also collide in space, though it'd be difficult to pull this off in a way that doesn't get you both killed.
</li><li> This was changed in the sequel, <em>Battlefront II</em>, where smashing your ship against the side of an Imperial Star Destroyer on Mon Calamari cruiser does absolutely nothing.
</li><li> One of the <em>Rebel Assault</em> games has a mission that requires the player to protect a kamikaze cargo ship until it can hit a shield generator.
</li><li> This is in fact the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedGlitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedGlitch">canon ending to that mission.</a> Wedge Antilles just ejected before he crashed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">which explains why he started the next mission in a different ship.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XWing">X-Wing</a></em>, the trope can be played hilariously straight. Rebel ships have shields. TIE fighters, interceptors, and bombers do not. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitedImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitedImmunity">Do the math</a>.
<ul><li> The situation is, of course, inverted in the sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TIEFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TIEFighter">TIE Fighter</a></em>. Veteran players soon learned to hate the A-wing fighter, not for its speed but for its unerring ability to hurl its cockpit directly through their windscreen upon being destroyed.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XWingVsTieFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XWingVsTieFighter">X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter</a></em> expansion pack <em>Balance of Power</em> uses this heavily in the final Rebel mission. After the player does sufficient damage to the <em>Executor</em>-class Super Star Destroyer <em>Vengeance</em>, a trio of Dreadnought cruisers drop out of hyperspace to ram it from behind, battering down whatever shields it has left. Then a Corellian Corvette rams its bridge tower to finish it off. All four ramming ships are unmanned and packed full of heavy explosives, which is appropriate given the sheer size of the Super Star Destroyer (and the fact that there's no Death Star handy for it to collide with after the bridge is destroyed). Any pilot worth his salt will however lower enemy shields instantly by attacking the shield generators. Just like in the movie...
</li></ul></li><li> Plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediStarfighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediStarfighter">Jedi Starfighter</a></em>. In mission 7, "Hammer and Anvil", the last action that Captain Orsai takes with his doomed cruiser <em>Kethor</em> is to ram into one of the shield generator platforms and expose Nod Kartha to attack. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Because the Kethor's already so badly damaged, Orsai has to pilot it into the generator manually</a> after his crew bail in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapePod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapePod">Escape Pods</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RogueSquadron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RogueSquadron">Rogue Squadron</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowsOfTheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowsOfTheEmpire">Shadows of the Empire</a></em> ramming your ship into things will hurt them. In the first level of <em>Shadows</em> you can spend lives to quickly wreck a couple of the AT-ATs to speed things along, though this will mean missing the Challenge Points you get for tripping them. This tactic sadly doesn't work on them in <em>Rogue Squadron</em> but it does wreck most other targets.
<ul><li> In the "Razor Rendezvous" mission of <em>Rogue Squadron II</em>, you can suicide-ram the Star Destroyer's bridge after taking down its shields and still complete the mission without penalty, even if it was your last life (as the life count decrement happens at respawn). During the Battle of Endor, you can also ram the bridges of two star destroyers bearing down on Home One, but you'll lose lives and also possibly scrub any challenge medal runs for that mission.
</li><li> In <em>Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike</em>, part of one mission involves escorting an unmanned Gallofree Yards transport as it rams the control center of a shipyard.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield">Battlefield</a></em> games, numerous servers have a house rule that ramming enemy vehicles results in the rammer being kicked from the server. You would expect that smacking a plane into a plane would destroy them both, and it usually does, much to the chagrin of the flyboys. Ground vehicles ram each other with about as much effect as you would expect, depending on what rams into what. In <em>BF2142,</em> the <em>infantry</em> can ram vehicles using Drop Pods (think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarshipTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarshipTroopers">Starship Troopers</a>). Initially, it was powerful, if hard to aim. However, post-patches, this ability was seriously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">nerfed</a>, in part to prevent physics exploitation.
<ul><li> A tactic that players developed in Battlefield: Bad Company, which has survived as far as Battlefield 4, is to set C4 on a light, fast vehicle like an ATV or Jeep, and drive at a heavy vehicle like a tank. Two packs of C4 will take out a tank, and as long as you bail out properly, the vehicle's momentum will carry it into the tank, and you can blow it up at your leisure. More inventive players have put C4 on unlikely vehicles, like helicopters, jet planes, and <em>UAVs</em>.

</li><li> Lt. Vega saves the day in the Mars mission, intercepting an escaping <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cerberus</span> shuttle containing vital intel... by broadsiding it with his own shuttle. His own shuttle is at least flyable after the collision, unlike the other shuttle. Vega catches some heckling over this maneuver from trained pilots Joker and Lt. Cortez, not least because the shuttle he was flying <em>was armed</em>.
</li><li> According to the codex, some military strategists consider ramming things at superluminal speed. The Mass Effect cores have hardwired safety systems to prevent this that no one has been able to remove. They theorize that the Reapers put this in their technology specifically to avert this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld">Homeworld</a></em> you can send a right click command KAMIKAZE! to turn your ship (regardless of size) into flying torpedo. In skillful hands, even the humble unarmed harvester can rack up quite a kill score. A ship simply trying to move through the space occupied by another can lead to spectacular results as well, though both ships will take damage; courtesy of some oddities in the engine and AI, the weird needle-shaped super-carriers in the nebula missions seem to score most of their kills when they sideswipe your ships whilst trying to aim their forward guns. Then there's that one level when the enemy strap a thruster-pack on a planetoid and use it as a really big missile...
<ul><li> Sometimes small enemy ships will scatter once the main force has been destroyed then one by one return and attempt to ram your mothership.
</li><li> In the sequel <em>Homeworld: Cataclysm</em> one of the ships is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Minion-class Ramming Frigate</a>, a converted asteroid tug equipped with a short-range fusion torch. If the enemy ship survives the initial hit it will be pushed out of the battle by the Ramming Frigate and left some distance away. A few of these can be used to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivideAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivideAndConquer">Divide and Conquer</a>. Ironically, <em>Cataclysm</em> actually nerfed the ramming mechanic by making collisions non-fatal unless the 'kamikaze' order is given. Too bad it's not that useful in the campaign where physical contact with a Beast ship will instantly infect the frigate as well.
<div class="indent"><strong>Minion pilot:</strong> Sorry, I chipped your hull paint!
</div><ul><li> The game backstory provides an interesting justification to the frigate's existence: Somtaaw non-combatants are usually ordered to flee at the first sight of trouble. However, on one occasion the <em>Kuun-Lan</em> was attacked by Turanic raiders while mining a valuable radioactive asteroid field. Seeing that the Acolytes are being overwhelmed, two Minions working nearby defied retreat orders and instead, the crews clocked the engines to maximum and tossed the attacking carrier into a turbulent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidThicket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidThicket">asteroid field</a> where it was destroyed by repeated impacts.
</li><li> In the same game, Mimics can disguise themselves as asteroids or even enemy ships. Though they made effective scouts, it was quickly discovered that these ships made very effective kamikaze attacks, since they could disguise themselves to get close enough to an enemy ship without raising suspicion. Especially since Mimics were usually crewed by those who have lost their entire family in the Kharakian Genocide and thus had nothing to lose. Cue the Quantum Explosives research option whose description states that while building a dedicated kamikaze ship is a regrettable thing, the command staff finds peace in the thought that their brothers and sisters took the maximum amount of enemies with them.
</li></ul></li><li> The second-to-last mission of <em>Homeworld 2</em> has the enemy command carrier pull this as a last-ditch attack. If you've killed all its forces and have it cornered, it'll launch a wave of fighters to kamikaze the closest thing they can find. It's more for spite than anything, as your attacking force will only be mildly inconvenienced by the loss of the few ships destroyed.

The developers have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">expressed a dislike for kamikaze ships</a> and have therefore left them out. There is a variant here, though: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">ships can smash into planets</a>, destroying the ship and damaging the planet (but adding to its resources). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts">Sparky</a> can also ram ships and destroy them, but it is unknown whether <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfALienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfALienLocusts">the Locust fleetworld</a> takes any damage from this.
<ul><li> Two other variants to this rule exists: Firstly, the Kinetic Kill missile is a high-level kinetic weapon that's effectively a guided warhead without a payload. The results of hitting an enemy ship with it are... Noticeable. Secondly, try putting a tractor beam on a defensive satellite. Since the satellite rotates, the ship it ensnares will rotate with it due to the beam... And usually ram right into the planet the satellite defends, insta-killing the poor ship. That's right: You can intentionally make a weapon that makes the enemy do kamikaze rammings of your own planets.
<ul><li> This may still be preferable to letting the ship live, as most ships usually have better weapons than defense satellites and will rain even more destruction on the planet than the ramming will cause.

<ul><li> Justified: the ship doing the ramming is an ore freighter, with no weapons to speak of. Except, of course, for ramming. It uses the ore it's carrying as chaff to protect it as it closes in on the opponent, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it turns out the "battle" was a test</span>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narrator">narrator</a> also has fun lampshading the obligatory "Ramming Speed" command:
<div class="indent"><strong>Narrator:</strong>: This is silly because technically you can ram at any speed. It would make more sense to announce an actual speed, using units of measure, appropriate to the amount of damage you wish to inflict. Shouting "Ramming Speed" only serves to alert everyone on deck to the impending event, allowing them to assume crash positions, or otherwise brace for impact. This of course renders the next mandatory shouted command redundant at best. <br/><strong>Captain:</strong> Brace for impact!
</div></li><li> Also Petey takes this in an interesting direction in his strategy for fighting big ships — his larger ships basically use his smaller ships as precision projectile weapons flung at close enough to the speed of light to punch all the way through an enemy ship and out the other side, taking out their power generators on the way. It's extremely effective offensively, but not all of the ramming ships make it back. He does have the advantage of being the boss of what's essentially a Cloud-based AI <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a>, so it's hard to call it a kamikaze strike. The second use for the ships, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">one humorously named Predictably Damaged</a> following the scheme of using the initials P.D., is to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">insert a living clone of Petey to suborn targets, given that the ships targeted had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a> that were programmed to respond to their creators</span>.
</li><li> Also subverted when Breya's embassy ship rammed the <em>Touch-and-Go</em>. TAG was being torn apart (and held in place) by gravity weapons, and the ramming saved the second ship (mainly because they could combine their shields, and Breya still had all her fuel).

Subverted in that this only worked because the Morokweng was on reserve power to hide from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>, and therefore had no shields or gravity weapons. Further subverted in that the actual <em>ramming</em> was a minor inconvenience to the city-sized warship designed to tank asteroid impacts; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">emptying the ordnance bays on the way out,</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">however...</a> Not to mention that said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> could see <em>them</em>, and followed them through...
</li><li> In Delegates and Delegations, Admiral Chu ponders ramming a battleplate through a city's shields to save that city from an enemy attack, an act that would kill the battleplate (complement: somewhat above 30,000) and cause hundreds of thousands of deaths in the city, but still save most of the city's 4 billion sophonts <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">aaand kill trillions in the ensuing civil war because it would have looked like Earth's military attacked its capitol in a situation that was already volatile. Good thing they found a better plan</span>.
</li><li> Also discussed and defied by Iafa and Elf. Somewhat funny when you consider how often ramming has already been used in the comic.
<div class="indent"><strong>Elf:</strong> Okay, I'll bite. When <em>do</em> you want to ram things with your boats? <br/><strong>Iafa:</strong> As a feint, when I wish to appear both desperate and stupid. It's a great way to convince enemies that I lack the ability to ram them with little things like missiles, and high-energy protons.

It takes a minute for anyone to realize what's happening, and by then it's too late. Eventually actual missiles and missile counter measures are introduced, causing a sharp drop in instances of this trope.

<ul><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Kamikaze">Kamikaze<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> attacks by the Japanese during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. While far from 100% effective (it's surprisingly hard to crash into a ship that's maneuvering radically and shooting at you), it was easier than attempting to aim a bomb or torpedo in that the weapon could be guided right up to the point of impact. The logic was unfortunately sound, and it got the Japanese more use out of their large groups of poorly trained pilots than conventional methods of attack. A similar but less successful experiment was made with Kaiten, a torpedo with a human to guide it. Whereas counting kamikazes sent out vs. those which hit a target gives it a better figure than regular aircraft, counting Kaiten launches vs. hits suggests they performed considerably worse than regular torpedoes. However, Kamikaze pilots were greatly reduced in effectiveness because of their generally inadequate training. This made them easy to shoot down for both US pilots and antiaircraft gunners, since they didn't know how to maneuver or angle their runs to evade the worst defense fire. They also often didn't understand the relative importance of different classes of ships or where to hit different types of ships for maximum effect. They often simply tried to dive straight into the first ship they saw, and quite often were shot down or exploded in flight. Note that <em>kamikaze</em> was Japanese Navy term, while the Japanese Army Air Force used the name <em>taiatari</em> (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Kendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Kendo">Kendo</a> term for combatants colliding into each other). Both were collectively called <em>Tokkōtai</em> (特攻隊, Special Attack Squadron).
<ul><li> The Japanese also designed a special kamikaze aircraft, the Yokosuka MXY-7 <em>Ohka</em> (<em>Ōka</em> translitterated in Hebon-shiki). Essentially a 1200kg bomb with wings, a cockpit, and three rocket motors bolted on, it was to be carried to within 20 nautical miles of the target by a bomber, then released. Seven Allied ships were sunk by them, including destroyer <em>'USS Mannert L. Abele</em>, though for a variety of reasons (Japan's impending defeat and the fact that the ships delivering the first production run were sunk) they saw limited action. American sailors nicknamed them <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokosuka_MXY7_Ohka">"baka bombs",<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> after the Japanese word for "idiot".
</li><li> The <em>Taiatari</em> tactics were practised also in the air - some commanders saw ramming as the most effective way to down the B-29 Superfortress. Sturdily-built Army fighters such as Ki-44 <em>Shoki</em> and Ki-61 <em>Hien</em> were considered especially suitable for that as they could both deal damage and provide the pilot a chance to jump with parachute. The 244 Sentai (fighter wing) assigned to defend Tokyo, had three ordinary Chutai (fighter squadrons) and a <em>taiatari</em> flight, <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hagakure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hagakure">Hagakure-shotai</a></em>. One pilot is known to have successfully downed three B-29 Superfortresses by ramming attacks.
</li><li> Of course, it also depends on the meaning you put into the word "works". By using this tactic, Japan was destroying three things it was vitally short on: fighter aircraft, fuel, and trained pilots.
</li></ul></li><li> The Germans considered this as well, on several occasions, generally towards the end of the war when they were getting really desperate:
<ul><li> Similar to the aforementioned <em>Ohka</em> was the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fieseler_Fi_103R_%28Reichenberg%29">Fi 103R<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> — a V-1 with a cockpit shoved in front of the pulsejet. However, while a unit (the so-called "Leonidas Squadron", officially V <em>Staffel</em> of KG 200) was trained to fly these (and theoretically bail out before impact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurbineBlender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurbineBlender">despite the engine intake being literally right behind and above the cockpit</a> and the lack of ejector seats), they were never used in battle, largely because the commander of KG 200, <em>Geschwaderkommodore</em> Werner Baumbach, thought they were a wasteful and stupid idea, and managed to convince Hitler that suicide sorties were "not in the German warrior tradition". However, in the early stages of the Battle of Berlin, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">over Baumbach's objections</a>, Leonidas Squadron carried out "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism">total operations</a>" against the Soviet-held Oder bridges using modified Focke-Wulf Fw 190s, knocking out one of nine targeted: a truly shocking waste of good planes and better men.
</li><li> In 1945, the Luftwaffe set up <em>Sonderkommando ELBE</em> ("Special Commando ELBE"), a special unit of pilots who, using specially-modified Messerschmitt Bf-109Gs, were to destroy Allied bombers by ramming. Only employed in one mission on April 7th 1945, they destroyed 23 US bombers. Only four pilots survived, the rest were either killed on impact, couldn't bail out in time or, in one instance, shot by a US fighter as they descended on parachute (banned by Eisenhower's order and considered very bad form then, and an actual war crime now). The attempt was not repeated. However, one <em>ELBE</em>-man, Unteroffizier Heinrich Rosner, managed to ram the lead bomber, a B-24 Liberator called <em>Palace of Dallas</em> out of the sky, before his wrecked fighter careened into the <em>deputy</em>-lead bomber, destroying that too. Rosner, showing the kind of luck the devil can only dream of, bailed out safely.
<ul><li> One of the problems the Luftwaffe discovered with the ramming program, though, was the fact that some US aircraft would <em>survive</em> being rammed. There are recorded instances of US heavy bombers taking ramming attacks to the fuselage, and in the B-17's case the tailplane, and successfully returning to base.
</li></ul></li><li> The German "Emergency Fighter Program", set up with the aim of producing aicraft that could be produced cheaply, easily, and in vast numbers to slow down the vast Anglo-American bomber fleets that were crippling German industrial production<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note213l2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note213l2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note213l2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The idea being that damaged aircraft could simply be replaced rather than repaired.</span> included several designs based on ramming:
<ul><li> The Zeppelin <em>Rammjäger</em> ("Ram fighter") was a parasite fighter with a specially-reinforced nose and wing structure, using steel tubing. It was to make two passes at enemy bomber formations: on the first, it would fire a payload of rockets; on the second, it would ram the nearest enemy aircraft and then glide to safety. At least, that was the <em>theory</em>. In practice, it was likely to have been a very high-risk operation for the pilot. No prototypes flew before the war's end.
</li><li> The combined rocket/ramjet Stockel <em>Rammschußjäger</em> ("Ram-Shot Fighter") was, in effect, a manned bullet surrounded by engines: carried to the combat box by a mothership and equipped with a steel reinforced nose it would fly towards the enemy bombers and, at the last second, the pilot would pull a release tab, which would fire the steel nose at the target whilst simultaneously ejecting him downwards to "safety". The <em>Rammschußjäger</em>'s original name was <em>Totrammjäger</em> ("Suicide Ram Fighter"), which should tell you all you need to know about how likely the pilot was to survive this process. No prototypes flew before the war's end (presumably to the delight of everyone ever).
</li><li> The Sombold S344 <em>Schußjäger</em> ("Shot Fighter") was related to Stockel's insane creation: the craft had an explosive nosecone which the pilot was supposed to fire into the nearest bomber formation, before it would explode, leaving the aircraft to crash and the pilot to bail out. Again, "safely". No prototypes flew before the war's end.
</li><li> The Gotha <em>Rammjäger</em> was another ramming aircraft along the lines of the Zeppelin version described above, unlike the Zeppelin, however, the pilot was to be ejected after impact: the cockpit was to be an armored cone which would bore through the enemy bomber. The pilot looked over this cone in flight; when he was in his terminal approach, he would press a button, the seat would automatically recline him behind the cone, the aircraft would ram the enemy, and cone-cockpit and pilot would be ejected from the fuselage with an explosive charge. An explosive charge was also at the front of the cockpit in order to blast a hole through the enemy aircraft at the same time. During free-fall, the pilot would be launched from the cockpit with a spring and parachute. To "safety". Even the Nazis thought this was batshit insane and most likely didn't respond to the proposal. Presumably nobody wanted to tell the pilots their new job was to lie down between two sets of explosives and fly a plane full of volatile rocket fuel into the enemy. No prototypes flew before the war's end. Obviously.
</li></ul></li><li> The Luftwaffe found themselves on the receiving end when it came to the V-1 flying bomb: the Doodlebug was a difficult thing for pilots to deal with, since shooting it usually made it explode into a deadly cloud of shrapnel, a bad idea when using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedForwardFacingWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedForwardFacingWeapon">Fixed Forward Facing Weapons</a> (and only the Mosquito and Meteor were fast enough to catch it anyway). One solution found was to very carefully put the tip of your wing under the tip of the V-1's wing, then roll away. This would flip it over, causing the primitive gyroscope that kept it flying to stop working, and it would rapidly crash.
</li><li> Bulgarian pilot Dimitar Spisarevski crashed his Messerschmitt into a B-24 Liberator bomber near the capital of Sofia as a last ditch effort to protect the city after depleting his ammo. It was in vain, as the remaining 35 planes were wiped out by the 200 American aircraft and the raid was one of the most destructive ones to take place over the city.

Amazingly, this was no kamikaze; the plane was actually expected to survive the collision. Stability problems leading to the death of the first test pilot kept it from entering production, however.

In some cases this was a result of trying to find <em>some</em> way for an inferior fighter to do damage to the enemy. In other cases, some of the Soviet fighters were so rugged that they stood an excellent chance of surviving after <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_ramming">ramming<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> an enemy plane.

</li><li> Considering the desperate measures they faced, losing a damaged plane and wounded pilot was seen as a victory if the Soviet pilot destroyed a non-damaged Luftwaffe plane.
</li></ul></li><li> Even the <em>Americans</em> got in on the action with their <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Aphrodite">Anvil and Aphrodite operations.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The goal of the operations was pretty much to take surplus B-17 and B-24 bombers, load them up with as much explosives as they could scrounge up, fly them to the target (usually something hardened like a U-boat pen or V-Weapon site), have the pilot bail and then guide the plane into the target like a giant bomb. It was mostly unsuccessful, being plagued with issues such as the heavy, lumbering bombers being shot down in the final dive, the remote control systems being inadequate to control the overloaded planes, and the planes themselves sometimes just out-right <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">exploding in midair with no provocation.</a> All in all, the operation was more costly to the Allies than it was for the Germans, with several pilots (Including a member of the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_P._Kennedy_Jr.#Operations_Anvil_and_Aphrodite">Kennedy Family<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) being killed in accidents and malfunctions, and only victory being the destruction of a German supply depot.
</li><li> In the highly publicized <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_U-2_incident">U-2 Incident,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Soviet Air Force General Yevgeniy Savitskiy ordered the air-unit commanders "to attack the violator by all alert flights located in the area of foreign plane's course, and to ram if necessary" to try to bring down Frances Gary Powers's U-2 spy plane. In the end it was brought down by SAMs, though.
<ul><li> The thing was, at that time (namely late-Fifties) The Soviet Air Force lacked both the planes and missiles that were able to reach the altitude the American spy-planes were routinely operating at. Building speed in a level flight and then trying to hit them (either with guns/missiles, though the earlier Soviet AAMs weren't very good too, or simply ramming) with a climbing attack was an only realistic way to bring them down. The matter was made moot in 1960 when the first Soviet high-altitude SAM, S-75 "Dvina" came online and brought down Gary Powers' U-2 in the incident mentioned above.
</li></ul></li><li> At a high enough speed, the kinetic energy of a missile will actually exceed the energy output of its warhead, even a nuclear one. Such <em>kinetic kill</em> weapons are therefore simply designed without warheads and effectively live up to this trope. Real-life examples include nearly every form of current or planned anti-ballistic missile defense, and anything designed to shoot down satellites in real life without resorting to lasers will most likely conform to this trope. Provided the relative velocities are high enough, many experts believe a real-life space battle will be conducted by spaceships launching smaller, pilotless kamikaze ships at each other. These same experts also warn that if a fast enough ship attempting to land on a planet were to lose control, it risks doing anything from making a really big crater to turning the whole planet into a rapidly expanding asteroid field <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Death Star</a>-style. As it turns out, Sir Isaac Newton really <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">the deadliest son of a bitch in space</a>.
</li><li> An asteroid capable of causing an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">Earth-Shattering Kaboom</a> is approaching? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Armageddon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Armageddon">Save the nukes for later</a> — just strap rockets into a lump of metal the size of a Jeep, and <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_impact_avoidance#Kinetic_impact">ram it against the asteroid<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>!
</li><li> Another example would be the APFSDS<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note50a4z');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note50a4z" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note50a4z');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Armour Piercing Fin Stabilised Discarding Sabot</span> rounds used by the M1A1 Abrams and most contemporary tanks. To visualize one, picture a Lawn Dart made of tungsten and depleted uranium, fired out of the main gun of a tank. The hell of it is that the glorified Lawn Dart is better at anti-armor work than HEAT rounds.
<ul><li> For the record, at 3 kps a kinetic kill weapon carries the energy of the same mass of TNT and it only goes up from there. At really extreme speeds (90% of light speed) the kinetic kill energy can exceed the energy output of an antimatter warhead (sort of), however at this point the weapon is horrendously inefficient because you have to expend many many times the missiles mass to get it to that speed.
</li></ul></li><li> The September 11 aircraft attacks left many people stunned, because not many people even thought that the aircraft themselves would be the weapons for the attack, instead of carrying terrorists and their bombs to the target, or blowing up the plane and its passengers, as it was normally done. It left a lingering fear that the Air Force may be forced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">shoot down other hijacked civilian airliners</a>.
<ul><li> Tragically, this is a real-world example that worked <em>better</em> than expected. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OsamaBinLaden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OsamaBinLaden">Osama</a> didn't think the whole towers would actually come down like that.
</li><li> Even more tragically, later examinations showed a strong possibility that the towers should have stayed standing. The only reasons they came down was that the anti-fire foam surrounding the central cores was blasted off by the impact. If they had stayed on, it is possible the towers could have been salvaged, or at least survived long enough to put out the fire and rescue the people still stranded above the impact zones. Also, the towers were specially designed to withstand airplane impacts, but it was assumed such collisions would be accidental involving aircraft approaching New York's airports and thus low on fuel.
<ul><li> This had actually happened previously — the Empire State Building was accidentally hit by a B-25 in 1945 and survived essentially unscathed, although 14 people died. The Empire State Building is, however, significantly more durable than the WTC was. It would actually stand a decent chance of surviving if a 767 rammed it.
</li><li> The other point to consider is that the WTC was built to withstand the impact of a Boeing 707, the most common airliner at the time. Max TOW 122,000lbs — while the 767-200ER that struck them weighed over three times that, a max weight of 395,000lbs with a cruising speed of 500 MPH. Conversely, the B-25 Mitchell weighs in at a relatively mere 42,000lbs and tops out at 275 MPH: the 767 carries more mass in fuel alone than the entire mass of a Mitchell, at nearly twice the speed.
</li><li> Also, that theoretical Boeing 707 impact was designed for on the assumption of a plane low on fuel and lost in fog, trying to find its airport and effectively blundering into the tower, similar to the B-25 incident. In other words a low speed impact with relatively little secondary fire, as opposed to a high-speed deliberate strike by a fully fueled aircraft.
</li><li> In a tragic case of fighting fire with fire, some of the first fighters that the Air Force managed to scramble that day were completely unarmed, and the pilots knew they'd have to use this trope to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/f-16-pilot-was-ready-to-give-her-life-on-sept-11/2011/09/06/gIQAMpcODK_story.html">stop any other airliners.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Thankfully, they didn't have to.</a>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The F4U Corsair fighter plane of WWII had an enormous, four-bladed propeller, to absorb the monstrous torque from its engine. On one occasion, a pilot, out of ammo, flew immediately behind a Japanese bomber and <em>chewed its tail off</em> with his prop. The Corsair landed safely.
<ul><li> Other sources state that the guns had jammed due to the lubricant freezing up. Either way, it's a true story, and the Corsair landed with <em>five inches</em> <strong>missing</strong> from the end of each propeller blade, which could've been enough to make flying a <em>lot</em> harder. The pilot in question is one Marine Lieutenant R. R. Klingman of the VMF-312 Checkerboards, and the Japanese plane was a Kawasaki Ki-45 Toryu, which is actually a fighter.
<ul><li> Take a look at some photos of the F4U and you'll quickly realise just how uncompromised this plane was: it was designed to have immense engine power both to better take off from aircraft carriers' short runways and also because air combat had become "dive and zoom" rather than dogfighting, this meant a hugely powerful engine and as mentioned above, a massive propeller. That propeller needed a large radius, but for carrier operations with rather rough landings you want very short landing gear struts because this is tougher. Therefore, the designers put a kink in the wings to get the best of both.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, during the Israeli War of Independence, an Israeli pilot literally cut the communication lines between the Egyptian Army and their command staff in Suez, by flying his P-51 Mustang through the telephone wires and catching them with his propeller.
</li><li> Using low flying airplanes to cut telephone or telegraph wires was fairly common during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. Several countries developed various special equipment to facilitate this.

His guns failed, so he rammed the enemy bomber, slicing its tail off with his wing. The bomber was destroyed, although Holmes' aircraft was so severely damaged that he was forced to bail out.

</li><li> It's worth a picky point that "ramming speed" essentially means "to speed up so we can do as much damage as possible". Technically <em>any</em> speed is "ramming speed".
<ul><li> "Ramming Speed" is a reference to ancient naval combat, where ramming was a particularly useful battle tactic. Most ancient ships during battle were propelled by rowers, and ramming speed basically meant "row as fast as you can". And, ancient ships being very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedsters</a>, the highest speed possible was essential for imparting enough kinetic energy on the impact so as to pierce or shatter hull of the target ship - if the speed was not high enough, it was possible the attacking ship could have been the more damaged by the ramming. The reason it wasn't used all the time was that human muscles and stamina couldn't sustain ramming speed for very long.
</li><li> It's also distinct in that ramming speed is essentially pushing the speed to the literal maximum possible without destroying the ramming craft before it can hit its target. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking">Explosive Overclocking</a>, essentially, with the emphasis on not exploding <em>before</em> ramming the target. For naval ships, for instance, this means pushing your ship to speeds that will probably wreck your own ship in short order, but since you're about to wreck it anyway...
</li></ul></li><li> Apollo 14 used a ram maneuver when docking with the lunar module en route to the moon. The first couple of times, the probe on the front of the command module didn't properly engage during initial contact, and it was feared an abort might be necessary. A last ditch method of coming in hard and faster than usual was tried, however, and that gave the crew time to engage the latches and manage "hard dock", the final connection of the two spacecraft, without having to worry about the usual softer initial dock at all.

However, the collison doesn't do much damage to the big ship, not until one of the destroyer's crewmembers sets off the depth charges on board. Even that is not enough to sink the battlecruiser.

White Flayer ships in particular are all built for ramming and are usually covered in rams on every surface; they aren't particularly effective at ramming equally sized vehicles as it usually results in them getting stuck, but they will utterly annihilate anything smaller.

<ul><li> During both the First and Second World Wars ramming was a fairly regularly used tactic against enemy submarines, the <em>Titanic</em>'s sister ship RMS <em>Olympic</em> and the battleship HMS <em>Dreadnought</em> both sank German U-Boats with ramming attacks. Ramming attacks were also carried out by smaller vessels like destroyers and escorts; however the damage (and occasional loss) of a rammer resulted in the practice being officially discouraged.
</li><li> The Japanese "suicide boats" (tiny speedboats loaded with explosives at the prow) and <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiten">Kaiten<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> manned torpedoes were used towards the end of WWII to little effect. Kaiten actually predated the better-known aerial Kamikazes. They were basically a Long Lance torpedo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">with a cockpit</a>. The problem was that underwater visibility was practically nil; only three Kaiten out of hundreds launched ever hit their targets. They also had to be carried to Allied anchorages by full-fledged submarines, and since carrying four or six Kaiten on deck really wrecked the sub's handling and made it more visible at low depth, many were sunk with their crews.
</li><li> Well before the Japanese even <em>thought</em> of their suicide boats, Italy had devised the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MT_explosive_motorboat">"barchino esplosivo"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (translated means "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">little explosive boat</a>"), fielding them against the Royal Navy and actually obtaining better results in spite of increased British surveillance caused by the existance of these boats and other means to attack unwary ships in harbor (the last Allied victim of a barchino, the French destroyer <em>Trombe</em>, was hit on April 16 <em>1945</em>) — enough that Israel used them in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabIsraeliConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabIsraeliConflict">Israeli War of Independence</a>, scoring two ships with the use of three boats. Differently from the Japanese version, the pilot was expected to jump after putting his boat on collision course, even having an ejector seat for the job.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece">Ancient Greece</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome">Ancient Rome</a>: the main naval tactics were to ram the opponents' ships and then use boarders to take it over if it didn't sink. The only other possible tactics at the time were either to board the enemy vessel (which happened just as often, if not more so, and frequently concurrently) or launch flaming arrows (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreekFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreekFire">Greek Fire</a>) at them once they figured out how to properly set arrows on fire (with limited success). Note that more often than not, the idea was to shear an enemy vessel's oars off rather than punch a hole in their side, in order to disable the vessel and board it.
<ul><li> Ramming-to-cripple lost favor to ramming-to-board tactics among the Romans, as it required far more skill from the rammer's crew, whereas boarding merely required that the ships crunch together so the marines could jump across. Other naval powers like Rhodes and Pergamon continued to ram with great skill, often racking up more ship kills/captures through ramming than their Roman allies during combined actions.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvus_(boarding_device)">corvus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was developed to offset the Roman weakness in naval warfare. By turning a naval battle into an <a class="urllink" href="http://www.stardestroyer.net/Empire/Tactics/Naval-Tactics.html">infantry attack<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the Roman legions could overwhelm the superior <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Punic_War">Carthaginian<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> navy. However, it's speculated that the change in balance caused by the Corvus led to the Romans losing multiple fleets to storms, before returning to simpler and lighter grappling hooks for their boarding needs.
</li></ul></li><li> Actually, after centuries of absence, ramming tactics were considered a feasible option after the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lissa_%281866%29">Battle of Lissa<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in 1866, where ramming manoeuvres brought the then-existing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Austria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Austria">Austrian</a> Navy a decisive victory over an Italian Fleet. Afterwards, battleship constructions tended to include ram bows. Unfortunately this led to the next generation of battleships causing increased damage in accidental collisions rather than being effective in battle.
<ul><li> In the early days of ironclad warships, most existing guns were not effective enough to serious enough damage through armor plates, leaving ramming the only practical means of sinking such ships with relative ease. However, gun technology improved quickly enough, though.
</li></ul></li><li> This tactic was seriously considered by the Royal Navy during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, because they were desperately short on ways to attack submarines and the depth charge hadn't been invented yet. Submarines on the surface or at periscope depth could be rammed. HMS <em>Dreadnought</em>, the first modern battleship, actually pulled this off — indeed, it was the only time <em>Dreadnought</em> ever managed to sink an enemy ship, and the only time a battleship has ever sunk a submarine, by any method.
<ul><li> The tactic was used (or attempted) against U-boats fairly regularly in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> when they were forced to the surface. Many escort vessels didn't carry guns powerful enough to penetrate a submarine pressure hull. When the United States transferred a large number of obsolete WWI destroyers, which were rather lightly armed, to Britain under the Lend-Lease program, they had their bows reinforced by filling the forwardmost chambers with concrete to improve their ramming capability.
<ul><li> The submarine USS <em>Growler</em> (SS-215) was operating on the surface when it collided with a Japanese patrol boat. The Captain was badly injured and could not return below deck in time. He ordered his XO to "Take 'er down!" knowing that he would be locked outside when the ship submerged. His actions saved the submarine and won him a posthumous Medal of Honor.
</li><li> Ramming wasn't entirely successful when the British submarine HMS <em>Clyde</em> engaged three German U-boats in Tarafal Bay (in the Cape Verde Islands) in September 1941. In a confused encounter, most of which occurred at ranges too close to launch torpedoes, <em>Clyde</em> almost rammed <em>U-111</em> (passing inches over the crash-diving U-boat) before colliding with <em>U-67</em>. Both submarines survived, although the 1100 ton type IXC U-boat came off rather worse than the 2200 ton River-class boat.
</li><li> Also there was the time when an Italian destroyer attempted to ram the submarine HMS <em>Proteus</em> (N29) only to have the sub's hydroplane rip such a big gash in the destroyer's hull that it has to be towed back to port for repairs. The submariners commemorated this incident by sewing a can-opener into their ship's flag.
</li><li> On 29 January 1943, two minesweepers of the New Zealand navy rammed and beached the Japanese submarine I-1. The US Navy would capture 200,000 pages of intelligence from the submarine.
</li><li> Fun fact: modern small warships (frigates, for example) can't ram modern submarines in the same way: subs are very tough to withstand high pressures, and small warships are built light as a means of defense against antiship missiles. They'd get pretty badly torn up in a collision with a periscope. Sort of — a periscope or other mast would be completely written off, but the fin (sail if you're American) of a modern SSN is strengthened to break through the icecap in polar ops, and any collision with it would rip a large hole in the warship. Still wouldn't want to be the first man back up into the fin when it surfaces again though, it wouldn't exactly come off well itself, and a collision with the pressure hull itself should obviously be avoided if at all possible.
</li></ul></li><li> And surface ramming didn't entirely disappear. Look up HMS <em>Glowworm</em> and its attack on the <em>Admiral Hipper</em> in 1940. Ironically, <em>Admiral Hipper</em> <strong>accidentally</strong> rammed <em>Glowworm</em> shortly after the deliberate ramming attempt was aborted because <em>Hipper</em>'s captain mistakenly believed <em>Glowworm</em> might be a minelayer and thus might rather catastrophically explode upon being rammed.
</li><li> <em>PT-109</em>, commanded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">JFK</a>, was cut in two by the Japanese destroyer <em>Amagiri</em>, pretty much by accident.
</li><li> Special mention must surely go to HMS <em>Fairy</em>, an 1897 Gipsy class destroyer, which on 31 May 1918, rammed and sank a rather larger and more modern (albeit slightly damaged) U-boat (there's debate over the actual designation, some claim it's UC-75, others UC-51). The ship was lost as well, but it was probably one of the few modern instances where the rammer inflicted more financial damage on the enemy than on itself.
</li></ul></li><li> The troop transport HMT <em>Olympic</em>, sister ship to the <em>Titanic</em>, rammed and sank the <em>U-103</em>, the only recorded instance of a merchant vessel sinking a warship in WWI. The <em>U-103</em> was not the only vessel to be on the receiving end of the bow of the <em>Olympic</em> either — she almost capsized the HMS <em>Hawke</em> by turning in front of her, despite the warship being designed for ramming. She also damaged the liner <em>Fort St. George</em> and sank the lightship LV-117. (There's a good reason people thought <em>Titanic</em> was an unsinkable ship—<em>Olympic</em> practically made a career out of smashing whatever was in her path.)
</li><li> In November, 1943, destroyer <em>USS Borie</em> rammed U-boat <em>U-405</em> before engaging in a running battle that was so close her main guns couldn't depress enough to shoot at the <em>U-405</em>. <em>Borie</em> and <em>U-405</em> were so damaged by the engagement that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutualKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutualKill">both ended up sinking</a>.
</li><li> Merchant ship captains were encouraged by the Royal Navy brass to attempt ramming German submarines during World War I, contrary to the laws of war. While most attempts were unsuccessful, at least one British captain who attempted ramming a U-boat was tried and executed by Germans as a "maritime guerrilla."
</li><li> Conventional naval wisdom from the launch of the first ironclad in 1859 until the advent of the self-propelled torpedo and advances in shipboard gun manufacture in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries held that major naval battles would consist of warships attempting to ram one another, since the crude cannons of the mid-19th century had proven to be no match for an ironclad's armor. Since this was the period when Britania really did rule the waves, there were few major naval engagements to prove otherwise. The theory led to many ships being equipped with ram bows, which, while quite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">pretty and sleek</a>, mostly ended up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">accidentally sinking friendly vessels</a>. The most famous incident, the sinking of HMS <em>Victoria</em>, gave us the memorable scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KindHeartsAndCoronets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KindHeartsAndCoronets">Kind Hearts and Coronets</a></em> where the admiral played by Alec Guiness goes down with his ship.
<ul><li> That said, there <em>were</em> battles that seemed to suggest the superiority of ramming over cannon fire at the time. These included the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lissa_(1866)">Battle of Lissa<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> between Italy and the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hampton_Roads">Battle of Hampton Roads<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> between the Union and Confederacy, which respectively demonstrated the usefulness of ramming and the ineffectiveness of cannons against ironclads.
</li><li> Ramming was also a common tactic during the American Civil War. Many ironclads, including CSS <em>Virginia</em> (aka the <em>Merrimack</em>) were expected to ram ships as their primary means of attack, and even a few ironclads were completely unarmed, making this their only possible offensive tactic.
<ul><li> In the case of CSS <em>Virginia</em>, its poor maneuverability thwarted its attempts to ram USS <em>Monitor</em> at Hampton Roads.
</li><li> By that point, the <em>Virginia</em> had already lost its ram after sinking a Union ship. Actually, had the ram not broken off, the <em>Virginia</em> would have followed the Union ship to the bottom.
</li><li> Ironically, the Battle of Hampton Roads <em>could</em> have proven exactly the opposite, that cannon could be an effective weapon against ironclads (as they eventually became). Both ships had weapon specs that might have allowed them to penetrate the other's armor, but for the circumstances of the battle: the <em>Virginia</em> had been issued with armor-piercing shells in addition to regular shot, but had left them in dock, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntSeeThatComing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntSeeThatComing">not expecting to fight another ironclad</a>; whereas the <em>Monitor</em> was using only 15 pounds of gunpowder in each shot instead of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">30 pounds</a> it was rated for, under the mistaken impression that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">the full load would put the ship in danger</a>. Had the two ships been able to bring their full loadouts to bear, the battle could easily have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">become much shorter and more vicious</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In fact, a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo_ram">whole ship class<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was created to ram through harbor defenses and deploy torpedoes against ships docked there, called the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Torpedo Ram</a>. The class never really took off, although it did "produce" one great fictional vessel: the heroic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarOfTheWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarOfTheWorlds">HMS Thunder Child</a></em>.
<ul><li> The torpedo ram (with a "spar torpedo") was a common tactic during the American Civil War — The CSS <em>Hunley</em> sank the USS <em>Housatonic</em> with one. And Lt. Alonzo Cushing of the US Navy sank the CSS <em>Albemarle</em> with one; in addition to the submarine <em>Hunley</em> (the first such vessel ever to sink an enemy), both sides employed non-submersible torpedo boats. This tactic was even more dangerous than it sounds — the contact exploder did not yet exist, and spar torpedoes had to be set off post-ram with an attached lanyard, exposing the person who pulled it (and in the case of the <em>Hunley</em>, having to leave the hatches open for seawater to get in, one of several suggested possibilities for the sub's sinking soon after).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> During WWII, the ocean liner <em>Queen Mary</em> was converted for use as a troop transport, sailing solo across the Atlantic and picking up a Naval escort only when she came within bomber range of occupied Europe. Off the coast of Ireland on October 2, 1942, the <em>Queen Mary</em> accidentally rammed one of the escort vessels, the cruiser <em>HMS Curacoa</em>, amidships. The <em>Curacoa</em> was literally cut in half and rapidly sank, killing 338 men from a crew of 439. The <em>Queen Mary</em> suffered no casualties and damage minor enough she was able to continue safely to her destination, drop off her load of Allied soldiers, and return to America for repairs.
</li><li> Entirely accidental, unlike many of the above examples, but the the battleship USS <em>Wisconsin</em> (BB-64) collided with the destroyer escort USS <em>Eaton</em> (DD-510) due to negligence on the part of the captain of the <em>Eaton</em>, both ships suffering severe damage. The damaged bow of the <em>Wisconsin</em> was replaced with the bow from the unfinished USS <em>Kentucky</em> (BB-66). The <em>Eaton</em> was also involved in several other accidental collisions, though only the one with the <em>Wisconsin</em> resulted in the captain being court martialed.
</li><li> Another accident involves the collision between <em>SS Imo</em> with the fully loaded munition ship SS <em>Mont-Blanc</em> in Halifax Harbour (1917). The resulting explosion created a tsunami and obliterated everything for a 2 km radius (i.e. most of downtown Halifax), killing 2,000 people. It was the largest man-made non-nuclear explosion ever.
</li><li> During age of wooden ships, where fire was often the greatest threat to any ship, many navies employed the use of fire ships. These were essentially abandoned ships that were deliberately set on fire and sent into the enemy fleet. If they didn't destroy the fleet, it would definitely scare the shit out of it. This was one of the tactics that helped the English defeat the mighty Spanish Armada.
<ul><li> Actually the ramming wasn't really the point, as a ship with no steering is pretty easy to evade. The purpose of fireships was to break up the enemy's formation (which was an absolute necessity given the English warships were smaller and fewer). In the case of the Spanish Armada, they were surprised at anchor and had to cut their lines to get away, leaving their anchors behind. As a result, they were unable to ride out the storm that did them in later.
</li></ul></li><li> Relatively recent example: in 1988, Soviet frigate Bezzavetniy rammed USS <em>Yorktown</em> (approximately three times heavier ship) to push it out of Soviet territorial waters. Neither ship was seriously damaged.
</li><li> The collision between the Italian passenger liner <em>Andrea Doria</em> and the MS <em>Stockholm</em> on July 25, 1956. The <em>Stockholm</em> struck the <em>Andrea Doria</em> amidships with her bow and had a chunk of it completely sheared off, but was otherwise undamaged and made it back to port (and is still an active cruise ship by the way). The <em>Andrea Doria</em> capsized and sank. A significant factor was that <em>Stockholm</em> had an ice breaking bow, which turned out to be pretty good and steel breaking.
</li><li> In the mission that finally eliminated Abu Sayyaf leader <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Sabaya">Abu Sabaya<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the Philippine Navy gunboat — which was quieter and faster than the speedboat the Abu Sayyaf were using — snuck in under cover of night and, with the direction of American night vision technology, aimed their vessel right at the terrorist boat. The speedboat was cut in half by the impact, and the terrorists thrown off the vessel where the Philippine Navy SWAG's (Special Warfare Action Group, the Philippine version of Navy SEALs) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">More Dakka</a> made short work of them.
</li><li> The aircraft carrier HMAS <em>Melbourne</em> sank two destroyers by ramming them. Unfortunately, they were both <em>friendly</em> destroyers — HMAS <em>Voyager</em> and USS <em>Frank E Evans</em> — in two separate accidental collisions. The US Navy after the latter incident nicknamed her "HMAS <em>Can Opener</em>".
</li><li> There was an ancient civilization who's entire naval tactics consisted of:
<ul><li> 1. Have one ship

</li><li> Probably the Greeks at the Battle of Artemisium versus the numerically superior Persian navy. They actually managed to capture a good number of the Persian triremes, but the rest of the battle went in the Persian favor.
</li></ul></li><li> During the First World War the toll amongst Britain's K-class submarines was high, with 3 lost and 4 seriously damaged:
<ul><li> K1 collided with K4 off Denmark 18 Nov. 1917 and had to be scuttled.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_May_Island">'Battle' of May Island<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> claimed a further 2 submarines sunk and 3 more and a cruiser damaged. HMS <em>Fearless</em> collided with K17, sinking it, and damaging itself. K14 and K22 collided, though both survived. K6, in an attempt to avoid a collision with K12 after some miscommunication, ran into K4 seriously damaging it, and itself. K4 later sank with all hands after a collision with K7, which also damaged the latter. Altogether 270 men were killed.
</li></ul></li><li> Two sailboat crews were attacked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuthlessModernPirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuthlessModernPirates">Ruthless Modern Pirates</a> in the Gulf of Aden. They deterred one pirate vessel with shotgun fire. When the other came around, the captain of one yacht chose to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ethiopianreview.com/articles/14522">"ram the bastards,"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">much to the pirates' surprise</a>.
</li><li> One of the major reasons that the main determiner of ships right of way is tonnage is because the bigger ships won't be able to stop as fast, and won't be able to stop until after they sliced any smaller ships that get in their way.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">Defied</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RMSTitanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RMSTitanic">First Officer Murdoch</a>, who elected to try to avoid the iceberg. Then again, considering that we're talking about a 52,000+ ton ship travelling at almost 35 miles per hour hitting a mountain of what geologists consider a sedimentary rock (resulting in the glancing blow alone generating the force equal to 37 contemporary express trains), the ship was held together with rivets and steel plates rather than welded together like modern ships, and the business end housed hundreds of sleeping passengers and crew... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Ramming might not have been exactly wise.</a> Not to mention that the first instinct of any competent sailor is <em>not</em> to ram their ship into an obstacle.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> by the <em>HMS Campbeltown</em> during the St. Nazaire Raid. Ramming the Normandie drydock was not enough to put it out of commission - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomebodySetUpUsTheBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomebodySetUpUsTheBomb">but the several tons of explosives</a> concealed in the the <em>Campbeltown's</em> bow was. It worked wonderfully, disabling the only drydock (outside of Germany) that could be used to repair Germany's largest warships.
</li><li> During the "Cod Wars" over north Atlantic fisheries between Iceland and UK, ramming was often the most serious option available to either side as actual shooting was not a possibility.
</li><li> In another accidental case, USS <em>John F. Kennedy</em> (CV-67) collided with one of her escorts, USS <em>Belknap</em> (CG-26) in 1975. While not a direct hit (neither ship's hull came into contact with the other), being an aircraft carrier <em>John F. Kennedy</em> has a massive overhanging flight deck. Which pretty much ripped off <em>Belknap</em>' <a class="urllink" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:USS_Belknap_collision_damage.jpg">entire superstructure<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>. Since <em>Belknap</em> had until just a few months earlier been rated as a destroyer (a "tin can"), <em>John F. Kennedy</em> became known in the US Navy as the "Can Opener".
</li><li> On 5 November 1942 during World War II, Finnish submarine <em>Vetehinen</em> rammed the Soviet submarine Shch-305 in the Sea of Åland and sank her. According to Vetehinen crew members, she was on a night patrol searching for Soviet submarines, which stayed underwater during daytime but usually came up during the night to recharge their batteries. A contact was found, and after confirmation of an enemy contact Vetehinen launched a torpedo, which missed probably due to being fired at too short distance. Vetehinen then opened fire with her deck guns. A second torpedo also missed, but the deck guns managed to damage the Soviet submarine which by then had started an emergency dive. The Captain of Vetehinen, determined not to let the submarine escape, ordered his submarine to ram the other vessel which at last was a success  the icebreaker "teeth" on the bow of the ship ripped open the Soviet submarine's pressure hull and caused her to sink. Vetehinen suffered a minor leak from the impact but managed to return to her home port.
</li><li> On March 30 2020 Venezuelan coastal patrol vessel <em>Naiguatá</em> rammed Portuguese cruise liner <em>RCGS Resolute</em> in international waters off the Venezuelan northern coast and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subsequently sank itself</a>. Not entirely surprising because the <em>Resolute</em> was built for cruises to Arctic waters and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">her hull was ice-strengthened</a>. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonStyle">Venezuelan authorities claim</a> that it was the other way around, that the <em>Resolute</em> was involved in deploying mercenaries to Venezuela and she rammed <em>Naiguatá</em> - "in an act of imperialistic aggression and piracy" - which would play this trope straight, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">but it would probably require</a> an uncannily swift and manoeuverable cruise liner to pull this off.)
