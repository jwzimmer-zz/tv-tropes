After getting to the White Sea, Ganfor tells them that there are other ways to reach the Sky Islands, and is stunned that the Straw Hats rode the Knock-Up Stream, as it's an All-Or-Nothing shot.

GX</a></em> manga, Chronos threatens Sho with expulsion for getting a 0 on a test, having him to duel Judai to stay (with Judai losing his deck if he loses). After Judai wins, Midori Hibiki reports that Chronos read a provisional report, and that Sho got a high score, only having it counted as a 0 for the preliminary report because he didn't write his name. Then again, given that Chronos is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher">Sadist Teacher</a> with a grudge against Judai, it's possible he never cared if the report was accurate.

Unfortunately, they have a very, very short life span. They believe that drinking Saya's blood will help... and savagely attack her. They eventually ask politely, and Saya gives them some of her blood willingly. Too bad her blood is actually poisonous to them, and it was all set up as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight">Let's You and Him Fight</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>: The King of Midland realizes this as part of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingDream">Dying Dream</a>. He realized that he didn't want to be king anymore, seeing his position as restrictive and leaving him lonely and isolated, and had a perfect chance to abdicate his position and have Griffith take over the throne as his daughter Charlotte's husband — and he was on the best way of doing so during the <em>Golden Age</em> arc. But then he found out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that Griffith had slept with Charlotte, and made the king realize that he was lusting after his own daughter</span>, which shattered his world-view and focus the rest of his time on seeking revenge against Griffith. He realized that, had he kept his temper and not succumb to petty feelings of jealousy and revenge, he could have been free of his position and enjoy the rest of his life with a happy daughter and a peaceful kingdom.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: In one of the anime's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a> episodes, Yumichika, Hanatarou, and Rin have to make a cake for a deceased patissier's mother, who died before his mother could ever taste one of his recipes. Since he's a ghost who cannot be seen by ordinary people, they have to make the cake and present it to his mother for him. Being Soul Reapers, they don't even know what cake is so are appalling chefs who take the entire episode to produce an edible cake. At the start of the episode, Rin is working with a device that reveals spirits, but it's only at the end of the episode that the device accidentally reveals the chef's ghost to his mother, allowing him to communicate directly with her. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a>, Yumichika irritably points out that they could have done this at the very beginning, thus negating the entire episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CellsAtWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CellsAtWork">Cells at Work!</a></em>: The allergy plot is a subversion. As the plot ends, the character realizes that the whole turmoil and disaster was caused by them overreacting to a mostly harmless allergen. However, the characters are cast of anthropomorphized cells, and since an allergy is your body overreacting to something, White Blood Cell comes to the conclusion that even knowing this, they wouldn't be able to stop it, since they are doing their job the way they should and it is the only thing they can do, much like your body can't decide to not overreact to an allergen.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato">Space Battleship Yamato</a>/Star Blazers</em>, after the crew of the Yamato is forced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">destroy the Gamilas (Gamilon) homeworld</a>, Kodai (Derek) is depressed about it, particularly because he and the crew had learned that the invasion of Earth was just to help save Gamilas, and the entire war could have been avoided if the Gamilas had just <em>asked</em> for help...
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato2199" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato2199">Space Battleship Yamato 2199</a></em> the human characters at some point that the war could have been avoided had <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of <em>their</em> ships not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeComeInPeaceShootToKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeComeInPeaceShootToKill">opened fire without provocation</a> at first contact</span>, and the whole devastation of Earth could have been avoided by simply surrendering (in fact a number of Gamilas characters openly wonder <em>why</em> they don't just surrender).
</li></ul></li><li> In the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>, the Wolkenritter assume that stealing others' magical powers is the only way to save their master. That's obviously wrong but they don't realize that until the late episodes, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">joining forces with the heroes</span>. Generally, Nanoha herself believes that everything can be avoided and always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorTherapist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorTherapist">inquires about the baddies' motivation</a> (usually, to no avail) before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">befriending them into submission</a>.
<ul><li> Unlike many examples of this trope, Nanoha and the other heroes didn't have any alternate ideas for saving Hayate, although it took them a while to find out about the Wolkenritter's goal. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The incident is resolved when the Book of Darkness is completed, Hayate manages to reach out to the book itself, and the heroes, the Wolkenritter and Hayate team up to defeat the defense program.</span>
</li><li> In the first season, Fate Testarossa refuses to ask for Nanoha's help in recovering the Lost Logia, even though Nanoha's only objective was that they were safely sealed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Although this probably wouldn't have worked in the long run anyway, considering the Fate's Mom was going to use them to break reality.</span>
<ul><li> Fate agrees to Nanoha's help in sealing the six Jewel Seeds in the ocean in Episode 9, dividing them between them... which gets her another whipping from her mother for wasting a precious opportunity.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JunjouRomantica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JunjouRomantica">Junjou Romantica</a></em>, Nowaki disappears from Hiroki's life for a year without so much as leaving a note. Hiroki is understandably pissed off, and when Nowaki comes back they have a fight that lasts for weeks before finally being resolved. It's not until after they've made up and decided to move in together that Hiroki remembers that, um, actually Nowaki <em>did</em> tell him he was going to leave... and, in fact, Hiroki encouraged him to do so... it's just that Hiroki wasn't paying enough attention to the conversation to remember it afterwards. Ooops. Like Hiroki says, "Wow... that sure makes me look like the bad guy here."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LetterBee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LetterBee">Letter Bee</a></em> has an example that overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Poor Communication Kills</a>. In the "Letter to Jiggy Pepper" arc, a girl named Nelly and her brother Nello were once friends with Jiggy Pepper before he left town to become a Letter Bee. Nello, dying of a disease, wrote a letter to Jiggy and confessed to being "so angry," which Nelly believed meant that he was angry with Jiggy Pepper, and caused her to steal Lag's crossing pass in order to deliver Nello's letter herself. It turns out that Nello was angry with himself for not being able to get better so that he could protect his sister, he encouraged Jiggy to follow his dreams, and Jiggy left to finance building a church in the village.

She keeps this from Adrien for months despite the damage to her business, not wanting him to sacrifice himself by returning to a job he hated and doesn't need. When Adrien does find out, he and Alya immediately start planning to get Dubois fired, and when Marinette raises her previous concern with Chloe and Nino, they tell her how badly she misjudged Adrien:
<div class="indent"><strong>Chloe</strong>: Marcel might have been able to pull Adrien back in if he had made it look like the company was floundering without him or fed him another line where it put the burden of the company back on his shoulders. In fact, he could have <em>still</em> triggered the Agreste Self-Sacrifice Switch if he <em>hadnt</em> jumped the gun and threatened you first. The minute that happened, not only would Adrien have not gone back, but he would have probably kickstarted this whole plan to put Monsieur Dubois out on his fat wrinkly ass all the sooner. <br/><strong>Marinette</strong>: Seriously? <br/><strong>Nathaniel</strong>: Marcel crossed a line. After he did that, his fate was sealed. <br/><strong>Nino</strong>: Hate to say it, but that definitely tracks.

According to him, the entire second war could have been avoided if either one had ever come forward with their information. Dumbledore's defense that no one listened when he said Voldemort wasn't dead yet is destroyed when Rufus insists they would have listened if he explained about horcruxes, as they're so vile that most have never even heard the term before.

In addition to using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">nigh-infinite power</a> or knowledge that they didn't have in baseline, several times we see loopers deliberately only using powers and knowledge they had in baseline, but simply making better choices. They're all <em>super</em> bored, so "Let's see what would have happened if I was smart" is a common pastime.
<ul><li> In canon, Twilight gets one spare ticket to the Grand Galloping Gala, and all her friends compete for it. It's only resolved when she refuses to take just one of them and decides not to go at all, but then Celestia sends her extra tickets. In one loop, Twilight skips the angst and just tells Celestia the problem straight off.
</li><li> Speaking of the Gala, everypony was disappointed that it was nothing like they were expecting. In the loop, Twilight explains what it's actually like and helps them achieve their goals without making fools of themselves. For example, Applejack wanted to sell her products out of a stall; Twilight points out it's a catered event with free food, but instead helps her get a catering contract.
</li><li> In one loop, Nightmare Moon is defeated by having the town greet her with a "Welcome back Princess Luna" party, proving that she was not forgotten and her subjects did love her night after all. Celestia says they should have tried this the first time. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">However</a>, Twilight notes that this only worked because they know how Luna and Nightmare Moon think. Without that experience, trying it would have been irresponsible and dangerous.
</li><li> In canon, Timberwolves attack and everyone runs around in a panic until they are barely able to defeat them. In the loops, Twilight reminds Spike that he is a <em>dragon</em> with fire against creatures made of <em>wood</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">And then it turns out that fire doesn't work that great against magical, living wood</a>.
</li><li> One of Twilight's most embarrassing moments in canon is generally referred to as "the Smarty-Pants Incident;" Twilight, panicking over the fact that she doesn't have a problem to talk to Princess Celestia about, enchants her old doll Smarty-Pants to make everyone obsessed with it, which nearly destroys the town. In the vast majority of loops, this problem is solved by her doing nothing whatsoever. However, in at least one loop <em>Celestia</em> starts freaking out because she figures that if Twilight isn't having any problems, that just means that the next problem is going to be much, much bigger. And in the rare loops where everyone else has to deal with unAwake Twilight, it turns out that the Smarty-Pants Incident is surprisingly difficult to stop; even if they prevent the first time it could happen, sooner or later the opportunity will arise again and Twilight will have her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">Freak Out</a>.

Lord Willoughby says he was sent to find Blood and offer a pardon and a commission as privateers in the King's navy. Naturally, Blood and his men refuse, putting down the King constantly with Willoughby thrown by how upset they are. It takes a line from Blood for Willoughby to realize the pirates have no idea the Glorious Revolution has taken place, James exiled and King William III offering the pardon.

Twilight eventually sends both tickets back to Princess Celestia, saying that if she can't bring all of her friends, then she doesn't want to go either. Celestia's reply is "Why didn't you just say so in the first place?", after which she sends extra tickets for all of the mane cast (and Spike).

Applejack tells them this at the end of the episode. However, Applejack falls into this as well. A lot of Babs's behavior made sense to the Cutie Mark Crusaders once she told them about what Babs had gone through in Manehattan. She did, however, explain she intentionally chose not to say anything to avoid getting Babs singled out over things the kid would rather forget.
</li><li> The fifth season episode "Brotherhooves Social" has Apple Bloom devastated over not being able to participate with Applejack in the Sisterhooves Social. Big Macintosh overhears Granny Smith telling her that that it shouldn't matter who her partner is as long as they both represent the spirit of the social. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser">dresses in drag and a wig</a> and pretends to be Apple Bloom's cousin "Orchard Blossom" so he can participate with her. After Big Mac is disqualified for unsportsmanlike conduct, the judges point out that his "Orchard Blossom" getup was pointless because there never was a rule barring stallions from the social.
</li><li> In "Grannies Gone Wild", Rainbow Dash is asked to chaperone Granny Smith and her buddies on a trip, while Rainbow desperately wants to go on a roller coaster. Rainbow eventually loses her patience with the old folks and ends up disrupting things. When the old folks find out what Rainbow really wanted, they point out she should have just told them. They would have been happy to go and they have a lot of influence, allowing them to get past the long lines. This was partially Applejack's fault because she assumed the old folks must avoid strenuous activity and told Rainbow this, underestimating their resilience. The episode ends with Rainbow and the old folks enjoying the roller coaster.
</li><li> In "Horse Play," Applejack repeatedly tells Twilight that lying to Celestia about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBadActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBadActing">how terrible her acting is</a> will only spell disaster. Twilight ignores the warnings, saying that she wants Celestia's dream of acting in a play to come true. When Twilight eventually snaps about the terrible acting, Celestia is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightBehindMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightBehindMe">right behind her</a>, and admonishes Twilight not for saying she's a bad actress, but for not knowing to just be honest about it.

</li><li> The episode "Three Girls and a Monster" has a giant, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh Invulnerable</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Captain Ersatz</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBigGuyAndRustyTheBoyRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBigGuyAndRustyTheBoyRobot">Yellow Taoking</a> shows up and lays waste to Townsville. Blossom and Buttercup spend the entire episode trying to beat it individually to show whether Brains or Brawn is the best way. Finally Bubbles, annoyed at the other two, just flies up and asks the monster nicely if it could stop destroying the town and leave. It does.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Silverwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Silverwing">Silverwing</a></em>, the bat colony loses their home because Shade looked at the sun, a rule that their rivals, the owls, had laid down for the bats to follow. His rival Chinook gets chewed out by his friend Todd for this, saying that if he hadn't insulted Shade and dared him to look at the sun, they would still be at home.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS1E15OnionTrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS1E15OnionTrade">Onion Trade</a>," as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">Onion</a> floods the town with Dave Guy action figues from Pearl's Replicator Wand, Pearl asks Steven why he didn't just use the replicator to duplicate another Ranger Guy instead of trading it to Onion. Cue "Dang it!" from Steven.
</li><li> The series finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MightyOrbots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MightyOrbots">Mighty Orbots</a></em> plays out this way. The Orbots' birthday is approaching and they're wondering what Rob is planning for them. So, they hack into his computer and find plans for robots that look just like them. They set out to prove their worth and interfere with Umbra's latest scheme. After they get in over their heads, Rob comes to help them out and they end up defeating Umbra once and for all. After all is said and done, Rob asks why they did that and Ohno reveals they found the plans. Rob asks them if they checked the date on the file and informs them they were looking at their own plans. He had something more festive in mind for their birthday and had no intention of replacing them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Reboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Reboot">Reboot</a>:</em>
<ul><li> One episode has Dot partially erased by a magnet and in need of extremely slow food from Al's Diner to reverse the condition, sending Bob on a quest to find some and ultimately ending up in a game cube with the food trying to get out in time to rescue Dot. She shows up in the game cured, though, as she is a business partner with Al and just called him up for an order. Granted she <em>did</em> try to tell him, but in her messed up condition he couldn't understand through her stuttering.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in one episode where Hexadecimal is musing over how she could enter the Super Computer with a snap of the finger whenever she feels like it but really can't be bothered, while Megabyte's entire driving motive has been to invade it but has been foiled at every turn. She laughs about how she'd be more than happy to whip up a portal for him <em>if he'd just ask her nicely</em>. Assuming she's not just messing around of course, <em>every</em> plot where Megabyte has tried to get into the Super Computer could be avoided.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower">Rocket Power</a>:</em> In "Big Air Dare", Reggie and Otto <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingRivalry">compete against each other</a> to see who is better at snowboarding. A guard escorts them off "The Big Air", a slope meant for experienced adult snowboarders only. They return to have the challenge the following morning where Otto <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">breaks his leg</a>. The same guard from before tells Ray that if Otto listened to him, he wouldn't have gotten hurt.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PJMasks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PJMasks">PJ Masks</a></em>: In "Owlette's Terrible Pterodactyl Trouble," when Connor scares Amaya as a joke in a school trip, Amaya begins to give him the cold shoulder to the point where she, on a mission, begins to disobeys his orders, unless he apologized, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RejectedApology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RejectedApology">but refuses to accept it for not being a "very big sorry"</a>, which jeopardized the mission and then put Connor in danger when he lost control of the Pterodactyl model to Romeo, while chasing after her. Amaya feels ashamed of all of that.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug">Doug</a></em> sees Doug accidentally breaking a ceramic knickknack that his mother Theda owns. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherBully">Judy</a> witnesses him do it and promises not to tell, but only if Doug will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeASlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeASlave">do whatever she says</a>. After slaving away under Judy's demands, Doug angrily reviews the contract she made him sign and discovers that it will be null and void if their mother ever finds out the truth. He promptly confesses what happened to Theda himself, and receives the fair punishment of being grounded for a week. Doug promptly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> the trope when he remarks that he would have been punished <em>less</em> had he gone to Theda sooner—she was more upset with him trying to cover up his mistake rather than shattering the knickknack, which she already hated.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur">Arthur</a></em> episode "Arthur the Wrecker" sees Arthur wanting to play a game on his mother's computer, despite her telling him not to until after dinner. When Buster persuades him to do it anyway, the boys end up making the screen go black. They can't fix it and assume the worst, so Arthur desperately tries to cover up the mistake and lies to his mother even further. When she finally <em>does</em> find out, though, she fixes the problem in seconds (there's a reset switch on the back of the computer) and tells Arthur that if he'd called her sooner or told the truth, he'd have saved himself a lot of unnecessary grief. As punishment for lying and disobeying her, Jane forbids him from playing any computer games for a week, which only adds to the trope—had Arthur just listened to her instead of letting Buster convince him to break the rules, he would have avoided any kind of punishment.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures">Jackie Chan Adventures</a></em> episode "Return of the Pussycat" has Jackie accidentally freeing the evil troll Spring-Heeled Jack, who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">turned into a statue</a> centuries ago by Simon Magus. Spring-Heeled Jack sets out to devour Magus's descendants as punishment. As the heroes chase Jack all over the city and wonder who he could possibly be after, they're shocked when he ends up at Jade's school to devour a friend of hers named Simone...which is when Jade realizes that she should have known exactly where the troll was going:
<div class="indent"><strong>Jade</strong>: Spring-Heeled Jack is after Simone?!...Simone...<em>Magus.</em> Big giant DUH!
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MuppetBabies1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MuppetBabies1984">Muppet Babies (1984)</a></em>:
<ul><li> One episode opens with the babies playing hide and seek. When they finish, Animal is missing. They go to search for him, but decide not to tell Nanny because they're afraid of getting in trouble. They fail to find Animal before lunch and decide to tell Nanny anyway. It turns out that Animal was with her watching television the whole time.
</li><li> Another episode has Rowlf taking care of a neighbor's pet mouse when the rodent goes missing. Again, they decide not to tell Nanny because they're afraid of getting into trouble and launch a search. The search gets interrupted several times by Animal playing with a toy police car only for the others to stop him. When they fail to find the mouse, Nanny gets involved and asks Animal to find it. He again plays with the toy police car, but this time they let him finish. When he finishes, the mouse comes out of hiding.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "I Was a Teenage Gary", Squidward offers to take care of Gary while SpongeBob and Patrick are out of town for the weekend. Squidward neglects Gary the entire time, to the point where he becomes severely emaciated. A doctor gives SpongeBob and Squidward snail plasma, but Squidward accidentally injects SpongeBob with it. When Squidward sees <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">its results</a>, he remarks "None of this would be happening if I'd only fed that snail!"
</li><li> In "Pranks a Lot", SpongeBob and Patrick buy invisible spray and trick Bikini Bottom into thinking they're ghosts. At the end, their ruse is discovered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedPeopleAreFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedPeopleAreFunny">while they're caught naked in front of the entire town</a>, no less. SpongeBob tells Patrick that they should have bought a whoopee cushion instead.
