An Audience Reaction is objectively not present in the work at all. It's something fans emotionally go through from experiencing the work.\nAudience Reactions are opinions, not tropes. Some of them may be very prevalent opinions, or may have inspired an author to play or avert a trope or may even be what a work is most known for, or be on the contrary completely unknown or privy to a selected few. We put a name on them and categorize them because they're a point of interest to both fans and writers, but they should not be confused with tropes. They are highly subjective, argument-causing and aren't a building block of storytelling the way tropes are. For this reason we have restrictions for when and where they can be listed or potholed.\nAn Audience Reaction can't be played with (Played Straight, Exaggerated, Justified, Subverted...)\u2014because it never \"gets played\" intentionally to begin with\u2014but for three exceptions:\nAdvertisement: When the authors are trying for the reaction in question.\n When the work is self-aware enough to lampshade the audience's probable reaction.\n In-Universe usage of an Audience Reaction (Meaning, a character has this reaction to a Show Within a Show or something to that effect).\nIf an audience reaction occurs or is discussed in-universe, it's acceptable to list the reaction in question on a work's main trope page. Otherwise, please place it on the YMMV subpage.\nCompare Character Reaction Index.

A special cutoff date for video game tropes, since they're even more recent than television.\nAn historical note: Several of the listed milestones in tropes existed well prior to the appended dates but either had minimal impact or were lost in later years. For example, movable type blocks existed in Greece around 300 BC but did not have the same impact on history as the Gutenberg Press.

Did the fanservice appeal? It depends on just how you feel...\nAdvertisement:Your Mileage May Vary on any of the articles listed below. What that means could be a couple of different things:\nThe article might call for a value judgment and your judgment call could be different from another troper's.\nExample \u2014 The article claims that a character is completely lacking in redeeming features. Your idea of \"irredeemable\" and another's idea of it might (almost certainly will) differ. Each of you is making a judgment call. Great! Have fun with that. It just doesn't go on the work's main page. We want the tropes listed there to be one hundred percent present in the work without coming down to personal opinion.\nThe article might be about differences of opinion or audience reaction.\nExample \u2014 Everybody who doesn't like the work have gotten together, formed a Hatedom and as such share a certain view of the work. As sure as the Sun will rise tomorrow, there will also be a Fandom and there will be wars and rumors of wars. These wars are stories of a sort, they are constructed from tropes like Revenge Fics, Fan Fics, trolling ... the list is pretty long.\nEvidently the fans and the haters enjoy these battles. Okay. Best of luck to them. The point is that there is no accounting for taste. Entries about this kind of story, though, don't go in a work's page; that is a place for storytelling tropes. Audience Reactions are a part of the conflict, not the story the conflict is about.\nAdvertisement:The list of all works that have an YMMV page is here.\nDon't add these in the main page. Not as \"played\", straight or otherwise. They go on the YMMV page. The rule against First-Person Writing-based statements also counts for these. For ease of quickly identifying items that belong on the YMMV page, just look for the links whose bullet point has been replaced by a fuel dispenser. But please, make sure that the entry is actually a YMMV example, and not a YMMV Trope being used In-Universe.\nBe aware that Playing with a Trope cannot apply to these YMMV items. They can't be subverted or downplayed or inverted or averted.\nThe only way this can be allowed on the main page, is if one of these tropes happens in the show, and gets that reaction from the characters that these tropes often get from the audience. This is what we call an In-Universe example. But make sure to use the \"InUniverse\" or \"invoked\" markup so that the bullet point will not be changed to a fuel dispenser.\nAdvertisement:Please index redirects to any of these tropes on YMMV Redirects rather than here, so that they don't mess up navigation via the index bar but still get the fuel dispenser.\nAt all costs, we highly recommend the Rule of Cautious Editing Judgment be followed on these pages. Use caution when entering examples.\nSee also What Goes Where on the Wiki, Trivia.\n\nSubcategories:\n Audience Reactions\n Fridge\n YMMV Redirects\n\n Abandon Shipping: This means that something happened In-Universe that caused people who used to ship two characters as a couple to not ship them anymore. As shipping is something the viewers do, not the characters, and some shippers keep shipping regardless, it is a YMMV.\n Acceptable Ethnic Targets: This means that it's okay to mock certain inborn traits. Seeing as some people think that it's not okay, or that mocking inborn traits is never okay, this is YMMV.\n Acceptable Hard Luck Targets: This means that it's okay to mock the Butt-Monkey. Seeing as one person's Chew Toy is another one's Woobie, this is YMMV.\n Acceptable Hobby Targets: Means it's okay to mock certain hobbies. This might offend people with the hobbies, so it's YMMV.\n Acceptable Political Targets: This means that it is fine to mock certain political beliefs. People have different ideas on whether mocking someone's political beliefs is ever okay, and it might offend people with the political beliefs, so it's YMMV.\n Acceptable Professional Targets: Means that it's acceptable to mock someone's job. YMMV as people have different opinions on whether mocking your own or someone else's job is ever okay.\n Acceptable Religious Targets: Means that it is fine to mock certain religions or aspects of religions. As you can imagine, it can be offensive to people whose religions are being mocked, so it's YMMV.\n Acceptable Targets: People who it's fine to ridicule. Seeing as people have different ideas of who (if anyone) it's fine to ridicule, it's YMMV.\n Accidental Aesop: Reading An Aesop when the writer didn't make one. YMMV as some viewers might not see an Aesop.\n Accidental Innuendo: When the writers didn't make an innuendo, but a viewer thinks something sounds dirty. YMMV because some viewers might not see anything dirty.\n Adorkable: When the audience finds characters that are cute or endearing because of their particular quirks.

Often literally.\nIn-wiki:\nPurely subjective tropes, or entries that concern the wiki itself.\n Darth Wiki: The wiki's Evil Twin. As indicated by its white-on-black appearance, Darth Wiki is the home of venting, complaining, and tongue-in-cheek criticism that would be out of place in the actual wiki.\n Sugar Wiki: Likewise, a section for mindless gushing and fandom, which is also not acceptable in the real wiki.\n Moment of Awesome: A great moment in a work that the fans will always remember.\n Awesome Music: An Ear Worm that is so Worth It.\n Funny Moments: All the scenes that were just flat-out hilarious.\n Heartwarming Moments: The moments in a work that make the audience glow with warm, happy feelings.\n Alternative Character Interpretation: A different way of looking at a character's actions which results in a distinctly different impression of their nature.

crying.\n Trope Codifier: The example that everybody else is copying, or at least copying a copy of.\n Trope Maker: The work that invents the trope.\n Trope Namers: The example that gives a trope its

The inverse, when a trope applies to many different series, is an Overdosed Trope. If you want a real challenge, look for a work page that doesn't use a single one of these tropes.\nMany of these tropes are popular because they are used as a verbal shorthand (Squick, Oh, Crap!, etc.), and others are popular because they're more ways of discussing works than they are part of the work themselves (Nightmare Fuel, moments of awesome and funny). In any event, the only requirement to be included on this page is that a trope is referenced by at least 2,500 other pages, as listed in the \"related\" page.\nAdvertisement:The numbers given here are for rough estimation purposes only, since the pages will inevitably have changed since the trope was added or updated.\nSee Also: Omnipresent Tropes, Tropes Of Legend, Trope Overdosed.
