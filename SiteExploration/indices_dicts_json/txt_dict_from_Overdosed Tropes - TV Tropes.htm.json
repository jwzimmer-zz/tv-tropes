{"\nTrope Overdosed is when a series uses many tropes. The inverse, when a trope applies to many different series, is an Overdosed Trope. If you want a real challenge, look for a work page that doesn't use a single one of these tropes.\nMany of these tropes are popular because they are used as a verbal shorthand (Squick, Oh, Crap!, etc.), and others are popular because they're more ways of discussing works than they are part of the work themselves (Nightmare Fuel, moments of awesome and funny). In any event, the only requirement to be included on this page is that a trope is referenced by at least 2,500 other pages, as listed in the \"related\" page.\nAdvertisement:The numbers given here are for rough estimation purposes only, since the pages will inevitably have changed since the trope was added or updated.\nSee Also: Omnipresent Tropes, Tropes Of Legend, Trope Overdosed. For tropes that attract a lot of potholes, see Pothole Magnet.\n\nOver 10001\n Big Bad: 53230 \n Shout-Out: 47768 \n Lampshade Hanging: 35026 \n Jerkass: 33027 \n Word of God: 29362 \n Deadpan
